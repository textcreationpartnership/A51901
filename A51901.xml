                  <note>The first edition of this work began publication in 1684, when a volume in Italian entitled "L'esploratore Turco" and a French version entitled "L'esplou du grand seigneur" were published in Paris by C. Barbin. Authorship is disputed, but it is generally agreed that the first fifty letters (the original four volumes) were written by Marana. In the English editions, v. 1 contains the substance of the letters commonly ascribed to Marana. The continuation (i.e. v. 2-8), said to have appeared first in English, has been variously ascribed to Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw ; Bradshaw has also been attributed as the translator (from Marana's Italian manuscripts) of the entire work under Dr. Midgley's editorship. cf. DNB; also Gentleman's magazine, 1841, p. 270.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS not to be expected, that the World will take it for an
Excuſe of the Tedious Delay has been made in publiſhing the 7th.
<hi>Volume</hi> of the <hi>Turkiſh Spy,</hi> to ſay. That our
<hi>Arabian</hi> now grows Old and Decrepid; is forc'd to walk with a Staff or
Crutch, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes in one of the following
<hi>Letters;</hi> and is beſides worn out with Sickneſs and Care; ſo that
he cannot be ſo expeditious in Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as he was in his Youth. It may
be ſaid, This Apology wou'd be more proper for the <hi>Engliſh
Tranſlator</hi> to make, were he in the <pb facs="tcp:102964:4"/>ſame Condition. But he
is in his Prime, in the Flower of his Age, Vigorous and Active; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might have made more Haſt, they'll ſay, to oblige the World, and Gratifie
the Expectations of thoſe Gentlemen who perpetually dun the
<hi>Bookſeller</hi> for the Reſt of this <hi>Mahometan</hi>'s Letters.</p>
            <p>It were eaſie to anſwer this, by only putting you in mind,
That he who undertakes to lead a ſlow-foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhort-winded, and weak
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by the Hand, and conduct him to his Journey's End; muſt of
Neceſſity keep the ſame Pace with his Charge, tho' he himſelf were
ſwift as a Stag when alone, and at Liberty, Beſides, that a Man is apt to
attract a Contagion from the Company he keeps, and turn their Ill Qualities
into Habits of his own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:102964:4"/>But all this is Trifling, and our <hi>Engliſh
Tranſlator</hi> is under none of theſe Circumſtances. To come to the
Purpoſe therefore, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, you will commend our <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator's</hi>
Wiſdom, for not being in ſuch <hi>Poſt-Haſt,</hi> at this Juncture,
when you reflect, That like a Wiſe <hi>Racer,</hi> tho' he gave a ſtart in
the Beginning, at firſt ſetting out; yet he ſoon ſlacken'd his Pace,
that he might make ſure of the <hi>Goal,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the Old
<hi>Engliſh Proverb, The more Haſt the worſe Speed.</hi> Thus he
ſuffer'd Three Years to ſlide by him, before he reach'd the <hi>Second
Stage.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2d. <hi>Vol.</hi>
               </note> And tho' he began to
take up his Heels more nimbly afterwards, ſo as to recover by Degrees, his
loſt Time and Ground, yet ſtill he did but moderately jogg on; now
ſpringing, then halting as Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offer'd, and as he found his 
<pb facs="tcp:102964:5"/>Strength could hold. At length having but <hi>Two Stages</hi> more,
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not, that he is a little more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than Ordinary in this: For, he
does it to refreſh himſelf, and keep his <hi>Breath</hi> for the laſt
Strain of all, which brings the Prize: Obſerving herein the <hi>Old Adage,
Finis coronat Opus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Letters</hi> contain'd in this 7th. <hi>Volume,</hi>
there is little to be ſaid more particular than of thoſe that have gone
before. They in General contain a Miſcellany of <hi>Hiſtorical</hi>
Tranſactions, <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Thoughts,
interſpers'd here and there with <hi>Mahometan Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks</hi> and
<hi>Divinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Only. You will find our <hi>Arabian</hi> engaged with a certain
<hi>Jew</hi> at <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna,</hi> in fomenting the <hi>Diſcords</hi> of the
<hi>German Empire;</hi> encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the <hi>Rebels</hi> of <hi>Hungary,
Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atia,</hi> 
               <pb facs="tcp:102964:5"/>and Mutinous <hi>Provinces.</hi> You will hear of
the <hi>Deaths</hi> of <hi>Count Serini, Frangipani,</hi> and
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſti,</hi> who were all beheaded for being Ring-leaders in this
<hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next and laſt <hi>Volume</hi> has this of ſingular in it,
That it will preſent you with the Riſe and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment of <hi>Count
Teckeli,</hi> who has made ſo much a Noiſe in the World. It relates many of
his Publick Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not a few of his Secret Intrigues. In fine, it
diſcovers the Train that was laid to blow up all <hi>Europe</hi> into the
Flame of Open War, and Univerſal Hoſtility, which to this Day conſumes
the Lives and Eſtates of ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
impoveriſhes and lays waſt whole Nations, and 'tis to be feared will end in
letting in the <hi>Turks</hi> once more upon us, to our final Ruine and
Confuſion; ſince <pb facs="tcp:102964:6"/>thoſe <hi>Infidels</hi> never take greater
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to Invade and Conquer the <hi>Dominions</hi> of

               <p>WHY was I made a Man, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure theſe Cruel Agonies, of which
no other <hi>Species</hi> of known <hi>Beings</hi> can poſſibly be Capable?
Or why, at leaſt, was I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Form'd of ſuch a Conſtitution, as
to <pb n="2" facs="tcp:102964:14"/>attract the Evils which are ſcatter'd up and down the
World, and Piece-Meal drop'd on the <hi>Nativities</hi> of other Mortal Men;
whilſt I alone am made the Common Sink of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Miſery? Surely my partial
<hi>Horoſcope</hi> Monopoliz'd the moſt envenom'd <hi>Aſpects</hi> of the
<hi>Stars,</hi> without partaking of the leaſt Benigne and Favourable Glance.
The <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> had laid up an Ancient deep Reſerve of <hi>Fatal
Influences,</hi> which they pour'd out at large upon the very Moment of my
Birth. Nor cou'd the Careful <hi>Midwife</hi> with all her Skill and Charms,
defend my tender, ductile, reeking Body, from the Inviſible
<hi>Cataracts</hi> which flow'd upon me from all the Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Signs</hi>
and <hi>Conſtellations</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My whole Life has been but One conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
wherein the Various Change of <hi>Scenes</hi> has not reliev'd me from the
Leaſt Real Evil hid behind, but only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz'd my Senſe with ſome New
Pageantry, ſome Fair <hi>Idea</hi> of Honour, Pleaſure or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; When
before the <hi>ACT</hi> was done, I found my ſelf cajol'd, and over-whelm'd
in Freſh Calamities; Misfortunes which I never dream't of.</p>
               <p>Oh! that th' <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> when from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſilent
Thought, he drew th' <hi>Idea's</hi> of every <hi>Species,</hi> and every
Individual <hi>Being,</hi> which he deſign'd for Actual Exiſtence in the
World, had Form'd me for a Tree, an Herb, a Blade of Graſs, a Stone, a
Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, or any Inſenſible Thing, Incapable of Pleaſure or Pain, of
Grief or Joy or other <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102964:14"/>Paſſions, which hourly thus
torment our Humane Race; I had been then a Happy <hi>Neuter</hi> to all falſe
Shews of Happineſs, and Real Senſe of Miſery. Oh! that I'd been an Oak, a
Beech, a Palm, or Cypreſs of the Foreſt: For then, if <hi>Vegetables</hi>
have any Feeling of their own State, I ſhou'd be only touch'd with ſecret
Pleaſure, when the Gentle Winds ſhou'd play among my Amorous Branches, and
teach my wanton Leaves, to dance the Meaſures of Young Harmleſs Love; Or
when I felt the ſeaſonable Rain diſtilling on my wither'd Bark, and from
thence ſliding to my thirſty Roots; Or when Great <hi>Phoebus</hi> prints
warm vigorous Kiſſes on my Cheeks and Neck. But if this be too proud a
Thought, I wiſh I'd only been ſome Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Shrub, ſome Pigmy Plant,
ſome Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Dwarf, a Page unto the Mighty Trees, ſubſiſting on the
Drops and Fragments of their larger Banquets, meekly cringing at their Feet;
whilſt I ſtood ſafe and free from Storms, under the Shade of their
extended Boughs, in Happy low Obſcurity.</p>
               <p>When I paſs through the Fields, and ſee the Harmleſs Sheep
browzing upon the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Graſs, and hear them bleating to their wanton
Lambs, I cannot chuſe but envy them a Life ſo void of Care and Pain. They
range and ſport at large in Flow'ry Meadows, near ſome Cryſtal Stream, or
take the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of the Mountains: Whilſt Chearful Shepherds tune their
Pipes, and ſing in Praiſe of <hi>Amaryllis, Daphne, Sylvia,</hi> or ſome
other <pb n="4" facs="tcp:102964:15"/>
                  <hi>Nymph;</hi> and watchful Dogs lie ſcouting on
the Plain, to give th' Alarm, and chaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſly Wolves, and other
Ravenous Beaſts.</p>
               <p>After I've let my Envy fix it ſelf a while on theſe, a
warbling Melody from neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Groves diverts my Melancholy Thoughts, and
turns 'em to new Objects. Then I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my Fate, in that I was not made a
Nightingale, a Thruſh, a Lark, or any of the Feather'd Quire, who with
ſweet chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Notes ſalute <hi>Aurora</hi> and the Riſing <hi>Sun,</hi>
and chirp all Day the Praiſes of that Source of Warmth and Life, who veſts
the Earth in Green Attire, who decks the Trees with Verdant Leaves, and fills
the World with Light. They chirp and fly from Tree to Tree, from Bough to
Bough, rejoicing in the Beams that dart and glide among the moving Shades of
Branches rock'd by Winds. Their Thoughts are taken up in building Neſts,
wherein to hatch their Young and ſhelter 'em from Injuries. They have no
Plots nor Politick Tricks, to undermine each other; but paſs away their Time
in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Security, and Harmleſs Pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Methinks, the Worms and little Reptiles of the Earth, are
happier far than I. They crawl and creep about in Hollow Trees, in Clefts of
Rocks and Crannies of the Ground, to hunt for Food and for Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement.
They live at Eaſe, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rack'd by ſupernumerary Cares and Fears.
And if ſome Ruder Foot of Man or Beaſt, ſhall trample them by Chance to
Death, or <pb n="5" facs="tcp:102964:15"/>more malicious Hand with Stone or other Weapon
ſhall wilfully bereave them of their Life, 'tis done ſo ſuddainly that
they've no Senſe of Pain: Whereas my Life's a conſtant Martyrdom; a long
continued <hi>Series</hi> of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>I do not complain of the Diſtempers and Maladies which afflict
my <hi>Body;</hi> though thoſe are ſometimes ſo violent as to make me
wiſh for Death, that ſo I might be at Eaſe: But 'tis the fretting
Anguiſh of my <hi>Mind,</hi> that forces all theſe Sighs and Exola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
from me. I am embaraſs'd in the World: Snares compaſs me round about: My
own Good Nature has betray'd me: Thoſe of my <hi>Blood</hi> conſpire
againſt me; they hunt me up and down like a <hi>Partridge</hi> in the Wood;
they cloſely purſue my Life. The Kindneſſes that I have ſown,
ſpring up in Blades of bitter Ingratitude and Perfidy. My <hi>Seminaries</hi>
bring forth <hi>Aconite</hi> and ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Weeds, inſtead of pleaſant
Flowers and wholeſome Fruits. <hi>Tagot</hi> has ſet his Foot in all my
Works. That ſly interloping <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> hates to ſee any good Thing
proſper, or come to Perfection: He ſteals behind us in all our Ways; and as
faſt as we weave any Web of <hi>Vertue,</hi> he ſecretly unravels it, or
deforms the Work with intermixing ſome Threads of <hi>Vice.</hi> I am weary
of ſtriving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Current of my <hi>Fate.</hi> Oh! that I were as
though I had never been! That my Soul were drench'd in <hi>Lethe</hi>'s
Forgetful Waters, where all Paſt Things are buried <pb n="6" facs="tcp:102964:16"/>in
Eternal Oblivion! Then wou'd my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh be at an End; Whereas I am now
rowl'd about upon a Wheel of Miſeries.</p>
               <p>Holy <hi>Santone,</hi> when thou ſhalt read this, pity me; and
amidſt thy Divine Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, dart up <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Soul to

Preſents to one another at that Time, which they call, <hi>New-Years
Gifts.</hi> And ſo it ſeems, <hi>God Almighty</hi> has appear'd very
Modiſn and Complaiſant, in thus timing the Nativity of the <hi>Royal</hi>
Babe: For which they expreſs their Thanks in Revelling, Dancing, Ballads, and

Sport and Mirth, to Liberty, Buffoonry, and all Manner of Comical and
Ridiculous Apiſhneſs.</p>
               <p>During this Time, you ſhall ſee an Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Variety of odd
Humours, and mimical Actions in the open Streets, according to every Man's
particular Phancy. Here you ſhall meet with one dreſs'd half i'th'
<hi>French</hi> and half i'th' <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faſhion. On the left ſide
of his Head hangs dangling down a long thick curled Peruke, which reaches to
his <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102964:17"/>Breaſt; whilſt on the Right you ſee nothing but
his own Hair, crop'd cloſe to his Ears. A long Muſtach as black as Jet,
graces the Right Side of his upper Lip; whilſt on the Left, he is Beardleſs
as a Boy of Seven Years Old. And ſo from head to Foot, he wears two contrary
Garbs. One walks about with Gloves upon his Feet, and Shooes upon his Hands:
Another wears his Breeches like a Mantle on his Shoulders. Here comes a Stately
Coach, jogging along with grave ſlow Pace, and drawn by Six fair Horſes, as
if ſome <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Cardinal</hi> were in it; when behold there's
nothing but a ſilly <hi>Aſs</hi> puts forth his giddy Head, with flapping
Ears, half drunk with the jolting, unaccuſtom'd Motion. Sometimes he brays
aloud, and then the Rabble fall alaughing. A Thouſand other Fopperies there
are, not worth thy Knowledge: For, both the Noble and the Vulgar are all upon
the Frolick at this Time, and indulge their wanton Phancies to the Height. But
'tis a fatal Seaſon for the poor <hi>Cats;</hi> few of which eſcape the
Multitude, whoſe peculiar Paſtime 'tis to toſs theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in a
Blanket till they are dead; or elſe to tie them Two and Two together by the
Tails, and then they'll bite and ſcratch one another to Death. The
<hi>Cocks</hi> alſo are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally great Martyrs during the
<hi>Carnaval;</hi> the Rabble have a Hundred Cruel Ways to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in

<hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> But they are the
Reliques of <hi>Gentile</hi> Vanity, in the Beginning conniv'd at by the
<hi>Prieſts,</hi> the eaſier to retain their Proſelytes in Obedience; who
wou'd rather have parted with their New <hi>Religion,</hi> than with their Old
Barbarous Cuſtoms. And thus the Pagan Fooleries were handed down to the
Poſterity of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> and were adopted into the
Family of <hi>Church Traditions:</hi> And Men are not more zealous for the
<hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf, than for theſe Ridiculous Prophanations of it:
So dangerous a Thing it is for Governours, by a Criminal Indulgence, to permit
their <hi>Subjects</hi> any Liberty which interferes with the <hi>Fundamental
Principles</hi> of the <hi>Law:</hi> For, ſuch a Diſpenſation once
granted, paſſes into a Precedent, which in Proceſs of Time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of
equal Force with the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf. And by ſuch prepoſterous
Methods of winning and retaining Converts, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> arriv'd to
the height of corruption it's now infected with.</p>
               <p>Sage <hi>Miniſter,</hi> twas for this Reaſon <hi>God</hi>

Practices appear'd to us, and yet what a Sanctity was manifeſt in others? How

the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of their <hi>High-Maſs,</hi> the <hi>Gravity</hi> of
their <hi>Proceſſions?</hi> And yet how great was our Diſguſt, when we
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that all theſe Honours were perform'd to Figures and Statues of

               </p>
               <p>We ſcann'd their <hi>Doctrines</hi> alſo, which we learn'd
from their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Books,</hi> and deſcanted variouſly
on them, as they were more or leſs conform to the Truth, and to the
<hi>Volume</hi> brought down from <hi>Heaven.</hi> In a Word, we prais'd the
Good, and cenſur'd what was Evil in their <hi>Faith</hi> and
<hi>Manners,</hi> or at leaſt, what we thought to be ſo; for herein we
follow'd the Dictates of our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</p>
               <p>But now in our Riper Years, if we ſhou'd call over our former
Thoughts, perhaps we ſhou'd be of a different Judgment, and find Matter to
condemn even in our own paſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102964:18"/>For whatever we

find them to be altogether ſuch groſs <hi>Idolaters</hi> and
<hi>Infidels,</hi> as we and all <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> are apt to
believe.</p>
               <p>That which gives me the greateſt Scandal is, That their
<hi>Doctors</hi> entertain ſome Unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Speculations about <hi>Three
Subſiſtences</hi> in <hi>One Eſſence,</hi> and are too venturous in
their Thoughts concerning the <hi>Eternal Generation</hi> of the WORD, and

<hi>Created,</hi> and are conſerv'd in their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> They teach a
<hi>Doctrine</hi> Repugnant to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> when they ſay, That
<hi>God has a Companion Equal to Himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the
<hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> aſſert nothing but
what is ſuitable to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches us, That he is the
WORD of <hi>God.</hi> In the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> they
indeed come ſhort of the <hi>Muſſulmans:</hi> There being not the leaſt
mention made, in the whole <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> of many
Paſſages in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and tender Years, wherewith the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi>
with other <hi>Holy Books</hi> and <hi>Traditions</hi> of the
<hi>Ancients,</hi> acquaints the <hi>True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> The
<hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> tells us, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpoke
in his Cradle, reſolv'd Doubts, clear'd up Miſtakes, and preach'd the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Eſſence.</hi> Other <hi>Writings</hi>
alſo inform us, That while he was Young, he formed the Figures of divers
Birds and Beaſts, of Clay and his own Spittle, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102964:19"/>breath'd on them, they became Living Creatures, and
proſtrated themſelves at his Feet. They relate alſo, That he made a
<hi>Pigeon,</hi> which flew up and down through divers Regions, and brought him
News of whatever was done in the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Foreign Princes;</hi>
and that from the Day of his <hi>Birth,</hi> to that of his
<hi>Tranſlation,</hi> Twelve <hi>Angels</hi> waited on him, and brought him
down Food from <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Of theſe Things the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
are ignorant, and of many other Paſſages. So that in the whole, it is
Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> have a more Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Relation of
the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than the <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
themſelves have, ſince we recount thoſe <hi>Miracles</hi> and other
Actions of his, whereof the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is ſilent.</p>
               <p>But then, on the other Side, they believe Things concerning his

<hi>Moon</hi> was in Sight in the other Part of the <hi>Horizon</hi> at the
ſame Moment: Which made <pb n="13" facs="tcp:102964:19"/>a great <hi>Philoſopher</hi>
then in <hi>Egypt,</hi> cry out, <hi>Either the Frame of the World is
diſſolv'd, or the God of Nature ſuffers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They tell a Story alſo of a certain Ship, that was on that
very Day ſailing in the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> and that as they paſs'd by
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rocks, the Mariners heard a Voice cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Thamus, Thamus,</hi>
very often and loud. Now there being one of that Name on Board the Veſſel,
he anſwer'd to his Name: Upon which the Voice ſaid, <hi>When thou comeſt
to the Iſland of the</hi> Palodes, <hi>proclaim it aloud, That the Great</hi>
Pan <hi>is Dead</hi> Which he did accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and there follow'd a horrible
how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and roaring from the Shore of that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland. This Paſſage was
afterwards made known to the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
at the Inſtance of ſome Noble <hi>Romans,</hi> ſent to enquire in the
<hi>Provinces,</hi> Whether any Remarkable Perſon had died on that Day; and
they were inform'd, That the <hi>Jews</hi> had on the ſame Day put to Death
<hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary.</hi> And <hi>Tiberius</hi> the
<hi>Emperour,</hi> on the Credit of this Paſſage, being alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of
the <hi>Miracles</hi> which <hi>Jeſus</hi> wrought among the <hi>Jews,</hi>
conceiving an immediate Veneration for ſo <hi>Divine</hi> a
<hi>Perſon,</hi> caus'd his <hi>Statue</hi> to be ſet up in the
<hi>Capitol,</hi> and wou'd have had him number'd among the <hi>Gods;</hi> but
in this he was oppos'd by the <hi>Senate,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had before
decreed, That no new <hi>Deities</hi> ſhou'd be added to the
<hi>Kalendar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In theſe Things I rely on the Account which the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> give of the <hi>Death</hi> of <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102964:20"/>
                  <hi>Jeſus,</hi> though they bring Authorities alſo and
Teſtimonies of their very Enemies, and inveterate Perſecutors, the
<hi>Gentiles;</hi> who therefore one wou'd think, cannot be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of
Partiality. In a word, I know not what to think of theſe Things. For, if it
be true, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> died on the <hi>Croſs</hi> for the
<hi>Sins</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> believe, and
that there is no other Way to be ſaved, but by believing this; then in what a
ſad Condition are all the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> the one
glorying in having murder'd the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and
the Other not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he was murder'd? The Firſt ſeem to merit
moſt of Men; ſince, though the Act was Cruel in it ſelf, yet according to
this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> it brought <hi>Salvation</hi> to all our <hi>Race:</hi>
And therefore there were a ſort of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in Former Times,
who worſhipp'd the <hi>Serpent</hi> that tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> becauſe
according to their <hi>Faith,</hi> that Temptation was the firſt Step to
<hi>Mankind</hi>'s Happineſs, after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; And they plac'd
<hi>Judas</hi> (who betray'd <hi>Jeſus</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi>) among the
<hi>Saints,</hi> for having been ſo particular an Inſtrument in the World's
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Jeſus</hi> be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> it
is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to believe in him. But whether he be, or be not,
the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in that Point cannot hurt them,
ſince our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> himſelf has taught us, That
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhall be ſav'd, as well as the
<hi>Muſſulmans:</hi> Whereas the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſay, it is
impoſſible for any to be ſaved, who follow <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102964:20"/>the
<hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> So that they have our own Grant for their
<hi>Salvation,</hi> which they deny to us. This is a great Advantage on their
Side, in the Controverſy betwixt us.</p>
               <p>For my Part, I tell thee ingenuouſly, were I convinc'd that
<hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and that he ſuffer'd
Death for the Sake of Men I cou'd readily embrace moſt of the other
<hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> without Scruple. I ſhou'd not be
frighted at their <hi>Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> ſince 'tis the
ſame as we our ſelves practiſe; nor wou'd their <hi>Images</hi> and
<hi>Pictures</hi> ſtartle my <hi>Faith;</hi> I ſhou'd look upon theſe and
a Thouſand more, as things indifferent in themſelves, and onely made Lawful
or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, by the Sanction of <hi>Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhou'd be moſt puzzl'd to know what <hi>Church</hi> to fix
in, among ſo many, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the Right Way. I have examin'd their
Different Opinions, and find Reaſon or ſomething very like it, on all
Sides. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the <hi>Abſtinence</hi> of the <hi>Greeks, Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
and generally of all the <hi>Eaſtern Chriſtians;</hi> yet their Ignorance
diſtaſtes me. I honour the <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Politeneſs</hi> of
the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and cou'd almoſt vail to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of
<hi>Antiquity, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt Doctrine;</hi> but I
am highly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized at their <hi>Licentiouſneſs, Pride,</hi> and
<hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly.</hi> There is much to be argu'd for the <hi>Cophti's,
Abyſſines, Melchites,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi>
and other <hi>Churches;</hi> but more <pb n="16" facs="tcp:102964:21"/>to be ſaid
againſt them. In fine, if I were to turn <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> I ſhou'd be
in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not knowing which Path to take, for Fear of miſſing the
Right.</p>
               <p>In the State therefore wherein I am, I will think Honourably of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Mary</hi> his <hi>Mother,</hi> who at her
daily Return from the <hi>Temple,</hi> found a Thouſand Sorts of Flowers in
her <hi>Oratory.</hi> I will not ſpeak Evil of any Perſon that has the
Character of a <hi>Saint;</hi> but in general will deſire the
Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of all that are near to <hi>God:</hi> 'Tis ten to one, if
ſome of them do not vouchſafe to pray for me. But whether they do, or not,
<hi>God</hi> hears me, and obſerves my Devotion; and if he pleaſe, my
Petitions ſhall be granted. As for the Reſt, I will endeavour, in all
Things, <hi>to do as I would be done to,</hi> keeping my Conſcience free from
Stain, that ſo I may die in Peace; and what becomes of me afterwards, 'tis in
vain to be ſollicitous, ſince the Decrees of <hi>Fate</hi> are
Irreverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Tell me now, my Friend, whether theſe Thoughts and Reſolves
be not more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Humanity, than to be a Furious <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got</hi> for I
know not what? Is <hi>that</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Zeal for <hi>Religion,</hi>
which under Pretence of defending the Truth, ſticks not to aſſert a
Thouſand Lyes? Or <hi>that</hi> a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Charity for Souls, which in Order
to their <hi>Salvation,</hi> takes infinite Pains to ſet the World together
by the Ears, and embroil Mankind in perpetual Wars? What elſe do 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102964:21"/>thoſe Diſturbers of Humane Race, who not content with
the Limits which the Fortune of their Birth has ſet them, invade the
Peaceable Poſſeſſions of their Neighbours, commit all Sorts of
Violences, Rapines, and Outrages; and all this under Pretext of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the
Manners of Men, introducing Purity of <hi>Religion,</hi> and fulfilling the
Will of <hi>Heaven?</hi> As if it were a Mark of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Commiſſion, to
be barbarouſly Unjuſt, Perfidious and Salvage; and that the Height of
Piety, conſiſted in ſhedding Humane Blood!</p>
               <p>For my Part, I cannot approve of theſe Practices, and
therefore think it ſafer to ſtand aloof from all <hi>Religions</hi> thus
Cruelly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, than by entring into their Inhumane Secrets, and
ſwearing to their Sanguine Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, incorporate my ſelf with profeſs'd
Murderers, under the Notion of being a Good Man.</p>
               <p>Happy are thoſe Innocent <hi>Nations</hi> in the
<hi>Eaſt,</hi> who from their Firſt Progenitors, have kept Inviolate the
<hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> Who never have defiled themſelves with the
<hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Beaſts;</hi> but every one content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf with his Native Home-ſtall, and the Fruits of his own Land, makes
no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments on thoſe that dwell near him, nor butchers the Harmleſs
<hi>Animals,</hi> to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his Ill-nurtur'd Appetite. Theſe ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Shade of their own Trees, and bathe themſelves in the adjoining Streams:
They go in Peace to the Houſes of their <hi>Rural-Gods,</hi> 
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:102964:22"/>and preſent 'em with Flowers, Rice, Fruits and ſuch as
the Ground brings forth: They never dream of Foreign Conqueſts, nor are
troubled with Domeſtick Broils, but lead their Lives in a perpetual
Tranquility, and Innocence. All that they deſire of <hi>Heaven,</hi> is the
Continuance of thoſe harmleſs Delights they at preſent enjoy. As for the
tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Pleaſures of other Mortals, they have 'em in Contempt. This is an
Umbrage of the Felicity we are promis'd in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where the Sound
of the Drum and the Trumpet ſhall not be heard, and the Inſtruments of War
ſhall be of no Uſe.</p>
               <p>If thou chargeſt me with Inconſtancy in my Opinions, I
neither deny it nor am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd: It being better to change ones Thoughts
every Day, than to be fix'd in Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror all ones Life. This to a Friend.</p>

Chance, Misfortune, and the Attempts of ſly deſigning Men; I'll be as

               <p>By what I have ſaid, thou wilt perceive I am in ſome

near <hi>Adrianople.</hi> I'm an Old Man, and yet they envy me the Happineſs
of a Natural Death; they would not have me go down to the Grave in Peace. I
have been impriſon'd, threatned, dogg'd up and down the Streets,

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102964:25"/>in Danger of being ſeiz'd, with thoſe of the

acquitted my ſelf Faithfully, come off with Succeſs, and ſaved the Honour

But for ought I know, my Care may prove in Vain, and the Evils which I have

<hi>Commiſſion</hi> be reveal'd, let the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the

               <p>About Two or Three Years ago, I was forc'd to remove from my Old

Yet even hither am I purſu'd by watchful Enemies: New Hazards threaten me on
all Hands. But I'm reſolv'd to fly no more, unleſs it be into the
<hi>City-Ditch,</hi> where I can find Admittance through my <hi>Landlord</hi>'s
Cellar. There is a private Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, dug perhaps in Elder Times, during

poſſes'd this Houſe. It <pb n="25" facs="tcp:102964:25"/>is ſo cunningly contriv'd,
that Human Wit can ne'er diſcover it, unleſs by Chance, or by Direction of
thoſe that know it. The Ditch is dry, the Door of the Houſe always lock'd;
and my Truſty <hi>Hoſt</hi> ſwears, no body ſhall come in by Day or
Night, till I have made a ſafe Retreat. So that if all the <hi>Officers</hi>
in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſhou'd come to ſearch, I ſhou'd have Time to pack up
my Papers, and ſlink away into my lurking Hole. And if they ſhou'd by
monſtrous Accident find the conceal'd Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, I cou'd ſoon ſlip into the

               </p>
               <p>This is my Final Reſolution, if e'er I'm put to an Extremity
again. In the mean Time, I deſire thee to make it part of thy Care, that
<hi>Mahmut</hi> ſhall not want for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to carry on the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s
Private Affairs without a Baulk. I do not demand Unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Things: Let me

<hi>Service,</hi> and that's all I crave. But let my Supplies be well tim'd and
proportion'd, that I may husband my <hi>Penſion</hi> to the beſt
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: Or elſe I muſt always preſs, and that's a Thing I hate. I
have writ to all the <hi>Treaſurers</hi> that went before thee on the ſame
Account, and with Equal Boldneſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take not in ill Part what comes

anticipate <hi>Mahmut</hi>'s Expectations, without exceeding the Orders thou
haſt receiv'd. Money be damn'd, if we cou'd breathe and ſerve our Friends,
and carry on the Affairs of Human Life without it. I am an <hi>Arab,</hi> and
cou'd as freely paſs away my Time in harmleſs Rambles o'er the

Fretting Circumſtances, the only Effects of too Unſhaken, Unregarded and

               </head>
               <p>I Know not whether I ſhall live to hear from thee again, or to
ſend thee another Letter. Age, Sickneſs, Misfortune, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the
Malice of Men, have laid a Thouſand Snares for my Life; I am, as it were,
hunted by <hi>Nature, Providence, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny,</hi> and <hi>Chance,</hi> into
the very <hi>Toils</hi> of <hi>Death;</hi> From whence it will be very
diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for me to eſcape. Not to amuſe thee, I am in danger of being
diſcover'd, ſeiz'd, impriſon'd; and then thou know'ſt, I can expect no
leſs than to be put to the Torture, and rack'd with a Thouſand Inventions
of Cruelty, That ſo they may force me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, what I am, and what my
Buſineſs is in this <hi>Kingdom</hi> and City, where I have reſided ſo
many Years.</p>
               <p>I was ſuſpected by <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> for a
<hi>Moſelman,</hi> as I have Reaſon to believe from ſeveral convincing
Circumſtances of that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi>'s Carriage to me, ever ſince his
firſt Acquaintance with me at <hi>Paris.</hi> And the ſame jealouſie
caus'd his Succeſſor, <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> to put me into the
<hi>Baſtile,</hi> where I was cloſely confin'd, for the Space of Six
<hi>Moons.</hi> And I might have lain there till <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102964:27"/>this Time,
for ought I know, had it not been for the good Conduct and honeſt Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
of <hi>Eliachim.</hi> In fine, though I have hitherto eſcap'd Diſcovery,
yet I cannot flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my ſelf, that I ſhall always do ſo. If they once
lay Hold on me again, they will certainly ſearch me for the <hi>Scar</hi> of
<hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> and then, all the Arguments the Wit of Man can find,
will not be of Force, to blind them any longer, or ſave me from the Vengeance
of the <hi>State.</hi> They will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put me to a Cruel Death.</p>
               <p>However, I'll baffle 'em if I can, and if I once eſcape, I'll
bid Adieu to <hi>Paris,</hi> if not to the whole <hi>Kingdom:</hi> Being
reſolv'd not to truſt any more to the deceitful Security of new Lodgings in
this City, and a vain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from one Precinct and Houſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For,
the very Air of <hi>Paris,</hi> is fatal to me. I am never free from Terror,
whilſt within theſe Melancholy Walls. The <hi>Genius</hi> of the
<hi>Place,</hi> is at Enmity with <hi>Mine.</hi> Every Thing I caſt my Eyes
on, ſeems to low'r and frown upon me; I ſtart at the Voices of Men, going
along the Streets, and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing about their own Affairs: And if any one
knocks at the Door, I'm preſently upon my Guard, my anxious Soul ſtill
labouring with ſad Preſages of ſome Calamity at Hand, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ruſh
upon me unawares.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, I may go to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where a Stranger may live
an Age conceal'd, and void of Peril, as in this City. Or, I may take a farther
Journey to <hi>Marſeilles, Toulon,</hi> or any <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102964:27"/>other
Sea-Port Town. Where I will expect new Orders from my <hi>Superiors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean Time, thou mayſt continue to addreſs thy Letters
as before: For that Courſe can never fail, let me be where it pleaſes
<hi>Heaven. Eliachim</hi> will take Care of all Things. I writ to the
<hi>Haſnadar-Baſſi</hi> on the ſame Account, deſiring freſh
Supplies of Money: Which I ſuppoſe will come by the Way of <hi>Vienna.</hi>
If ſo, I truſt to thy Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in ordering my <hi>Bills</hi> with Speed,
and the uſual Cautiouſneſs.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I cannot for the future ſtand the Brunt of long ſuſpected

Contingencies appear, which are to come, <pb n="31" facs="tcp:102964:28"/>uncertain, and

               <p>'Tis ſad, moſt <hi>Holy Patriarch</hi> of the

whilſt every <hi>Citizen</hi> preys <pb n="32" facs="tcp:102964:29"/>on his Neighbour, and
devours him, whom he has ſworn to protect. They all live by Robbery and
Spoil. The Rich and Potent, fleece thoſe whoſe Wealth is not ſufficient
to defend them from Oppreſſion. Thus are Towns and Cities, from celebrated
<hi>Refuges</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> become the <hi>Dens</hi> of <hi>Thieves,</hi>

Envy, and a Thouſand other Vices. Brother can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not truſt the Son of his own

the Days tedious which prolong their Parents Lives. Self-Love teaches a Man to

Invocation of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Allah,</hi> cancels theſe
<hi>Peccadillo's;</hi> they are all put to the Account of Human Frailty: Such
is the Pleaſure of Eternal Goodneſs. But I accuſe the blacker Crimes of
thoſe, whom fretting Envy ſtimulates to perſecute their harmleſs
Neighbour; or baſe Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude prompts to betray their Friends; or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Malice teaches to ſeek out all Occaſions of doing Miſchief in the World.
A Buſy, Reſtleſs ſort of Men, buzzing about like Waſps or Hornets,

               <p>Such are the <hi>Men</hi> of whom I now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain; who hatter me

much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration among all that hear of it, and rais'd learned Diſputes

               </p>
               <p>In the Town of <hi>Weerted</hi> near <hi>Ardenburgh</hi> in the
<hi>Low Countries,</hi> a Woman was lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of a Monſtrous Child
with Two Heads, Two Necks, Four Arms, and proportionably all Parts both outward
and inward double to the Navil, which ſeem'd to be the Center of Union
between the Two Bodies: For from thence downwards, there appeared only the
Proportion and Shape of One Body, with Two Thighs, Legs and Feet. The Faces
were different; One Squalid and Irregular, without a Noſe or Mouth, except a
Kind of Orifice under the Chin; For the Eyes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd the Place of the
Mouth, and a perfect <hi>Maſculine Genital</hi> took up the Room of the
Noſe: The other was fair and made with Symetry, having nothing extraordinary,
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <pb n="37" facs="tcp:102964:31"/>Two Teeth grown out of the Gums.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Irregular Production</hi> has been curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
diſſected by a Famous <hi>Anatomiſt,</hi> who found Two Hearts, Two
Stomachs, and the other Vitals all ſingle. What I have ſaid is atteſted

               <p>There have been many Examples of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>Births,</hi>

whether any of theſe <hi>Whelps</hi> were of a promiſing Aſpect: When to
his Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he found Eleven of Humane Shape, all Living and Perfect,
but very ſmall. He preſs'd the Maid ſo far, that ſhe confeſs'd the
whole Truth. Whereupon enjoining her Silence, and Aſſurance of a good
Reward, he caus'd her to carry them to one of his <hi>Tenants;</hi> where being
all cheriſh'd and laid warm, he diſpos'd of them afterwards in convenient
Places, to be nurs'd and brought up till they came of Age. Then he ſent for
them private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Houſe, having firſt apparelled them in the ſame
Faſhion as their Brother was in who dwelt at Home.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Counteſs</hi> caſt her Eye on them, and
obſerv'd their Number and Faces, ſo exactly reſembling him who had been
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with her, ſhe wept in a Paſſion betwixt Shame and Joy,
confeſſing her former Cruel Intention; and falling at the Feet of her
<hi>Lord,</hi> he pardon'd her. From theſe <hi>Eleven</hi> deſcend the
<hi>Family</hi> of the <hi>Welphs</hi> or <hi>Guelphs,</hi> ſo Renowned in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and bearing this Name from the Maid's Anſwer to the
<hi>Earl,</hi> when ſhe had them in her Lap.</p>

<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumcis'd,</hi> That all Things Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and Inviſible are from

Antiques, with the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Senſes of every Age.</p>
               <p>What I have writ, is to divert thee; But when ſhall I have an

<hi>Hali,</hi> be not too much a <hi>Courtier.</hi> Thy long Silence and
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedneſs forces this Language from me. Shall <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
blot out thy Remembrance of <hi>Arabia?</hi> Or, the Blaſt of a

               </head>
               <p>NOW I ſee thou art a Man of Buſineſs: Thy Mind is cur'd of
its <hi>Religious</hi> Itch, and reſtor'd to a ſound Complexion.
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, and be Happy.</p>
               <p>Let no vain Scruples of Conſcience moleſt thy <hi>Soul,</hi>
concerning the <hi>Peace</hi> that was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made between the <hi>Grand
Signior</hi> and the <hi>Germans.</hi> Cares of this Nature belong to thoſe
who ſit at the Helm, and direct the Steerage of the <hi>State.</hi> As for
thee and me, our Part is onely to Obey, without enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, whether it be Right
or Wrong that we are commanded. Every Thing is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to us, that is enjoin'd
by our <hi>Superiours;</hi> And the <hi>Publick</hi> Reaſon ought to
ſuperſede our Private narrow Sentiments. Whatever <hi>Praemunire's</hi> we
incurr by our Obedience, the Conſcience of the <hi>State</hi> will be our
Bail, our Advocate, and our Ranſom. Therefore, once more, Go on and
proſper.</p>
               <p>Thou cou'dſt not have done the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> a
greater Piece of Service, than by thus happily inſinuating thy ſelf with
the <hi>Hungarian Faction</hi> at <hi>Vienna:</hi> For, by that Means, thou
becomeſt <hi>Maſter</hi> of the <hi>Secrets</hi> on both Sides; the
<hi>Janus</hi> that over-looks <pb n="42" facs="tcp:102964:34"/>Two oppoſite Cabals at
once: And ſo mayſt not only form thy own Intrigues the better, but alſo
give a clearer Light to the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> of the <hi>Sublime
Port.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am diſpleas'd to hear of the frequent
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies</hi> that have been made againſt the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi>'s
Perſon. Not for any Love that I bear to him or the Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria:</hi> For, I wiſh there was not a <hi>Branch</hi> of that
<hi>Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Stem</hi> left alive on Earth: But, I never knew ſuch Kind
of <hi>Plots,</hi> if once diſcovered and prevented, to take Effect again.
Beſides, they many Times ſpoil the main Deſign: For, what ſignifies it,
if this <hi>Emperour</hi> were ſeiz'd and put to Death, ſo long as there is
any one of that <hi>Tyrannical Race</hi> ſurviving. They are all of the
ſame Blood and Intereſt; Educated alſo in the ſame <hi>Principles</hi>
and <hi>Maxims.</hi> In a Word, they have all but one Game to play; which is,
to aggrandize them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Poſterity for ever. And therefore
theſe Clandeſtine Methods of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Aſſaſſine, will but make
them more watchful, to prevent all Deſigns of the like Nature, for the
Future.</p>
               <p>Remember <hi>Nathan,</hi> that the Mark which thou art to aim
at, is to cheriſh the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by all the Arts of
a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Stateſman.</hi> Count <hi>Peter de Serini,</hi> is a fit
Subject to work upon. The Death of his Brother, and his own Diſgrace at the
<hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court,</hi> with the riſing Fortune of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecuculi,</hi>
have fill'd him with Sentiments of Revenge and Envy. He cannot behold 
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102964:34"/>Count <hi>d' Averſperg</hi> in Poſſeſſion of
<hi>Carle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadt,</hi> without much Reſentment, having with ſo great
Paſſion, begg'd that <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for himſelf.</p>
               <p>If this <hi>Prince</hi> can but be induc'd to revolt, many
Thouſands of the <hi>Croats, Dalmatians,</hi> and <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> will
take up <hi>Arms</hi> under him, which will at once weaken both the <hi>German
Empire,</hi> and the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> Beſides, the Marriage
of his Daughter with <hi>Prince Ragotski,</hi> may engage the
<hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in his Party. Count <hi>Nadaſti</hi> alſo, they
ſay, is not well pleaſed with the <hi>Court,</hi> aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be
<hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Hungary;</hi> which has been refus'd him. This News
comes to me but by Report. If it be true, thou art in the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Way to
ſucceed. Such great Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents as theſe, will puzzle the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and exerciſe the Policy of <hi>Prince
Lob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kovitz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, if Things ſhou'd not proceed to an open Rupture;
yet, thou know'ſt, the <hi>Hungarians</hi> are offended at the late
<hi>Peace,</hi> which will not fail to put them upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting perpetual Acts
of Hoſtility. They ſtomach it extremely, That the Town of
<hi>Newhauſel</hi> is in the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Hands. And they will be
always on their Guard in the Neighbouring Parts, Patrôling about, and
skirmiſhing with our Foragers: Which will afford a good Occaſion at any
Time for our Sovereign to break the Peace, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is for his Intereſt.
There are Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Conſequences in ſuch a Caſe, <pb n="44" facs="tcp:102964:35"/>more than we can think of, or foreſee, yet all to our Advantage. As
long as we go the right way to Work, all Things will ſucceed well. Make no
falſe Steps, and there's no Danger of ſtumbling.</p>
               <p>Remember ſtill, That thy particular Charge, is to foment a
<hi>Civil War</hi> between the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the
<hi>Hungarians.</hi> 'Tis no Matter, who gets the better on't. Let 'em quarrel
to Eternity, and deſtroy one another in <hi>God</hi>'s Name. Then ſhall the
<hi>Muſſulman Empire</hi> thrive.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>God,</hi> you have a fine Opportunity, ye Factious
Comrades: But, beware of ſly Interlopers. Damn the Eaſineſs, and good
Nature (falſly ſo call'd) of thoſe, who will admit any Man into their
Cabal, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he puts on a fair Guiſe, of one of the Party. Ye can't be
too reſerv'd and cloſe. D'ye think, the <hi>Emperour</hi> has not his Spies
about in every Corner? A Pox of your Stupidity, if you ſuffer this brave
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to miſcarry for want of looking ſharp. Damn ye for a parcel of
Old Thread-bare Fools, if after ſo many Experiences, you don't furbiſh up
your Wits, and look to your ſelves. There's <hi>Gottendorf, Railliwits,
Skus,</hi> the <hi>Knight, Baron Leipſem, Eluard</hi> the <hi>Hereditary</hi>
Pretender to the <hi>Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate</hi> of <hi>Thanu,</hi> with many others,

               <p>I Know not whether I have Reaſon to rejoice or be ſad, in my
preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; ſo Ambiguous are the Events of Human Life. Even
the moſt blandiſhing Gifts of Fortune, and ſuch as we are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken with, many Times prove like the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, onely fair and
Gay in outward Appearance; whilſt like that deceitful Engine of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Craft, they carry an Army of Hidden Calamities within, which
in the midſt of our ſecure Repoſe, when we leaſt dream of any Evil,
ruſh upon us from their conceal'd and unſuſpected Ambuſcades, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
us all in Terrour and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>However, ſince I have had a ſufficient ſhare of Trouble,
Grief, and Melancholy; now let other ſprightly, chearful Paſſions take
their Turn, be the Event how it will. I cannot always bear the Burden of a
loaded Spleen, cramm'd and puff'd up with Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Winds, the
<hi>Embryo's</hi> or Vehicles at <pb n="52" facs="tcp:102964:39"/>leaſt, of horrid
Thoughts, perplexing Cares, and black Deſpair. Beſides, methinks, I have a
fit Occaſion to be merry; being by a very pleaſant Accident, at once rid of
a great many vain Doubts and Anxieties, (which have diſturb'd my Peace for
theſe Three or Four Years) and reſtor'd to the charming Converſation of
<hi>Daria,</hi> whom thou may'ſt remember, I ſo paſſionately lov'd, in
the Days of my Youth.</p>
               <p>Know then, that one Day as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Streets, I met
that lovely <hi>Greek</hi> in <hi>Mourning.</hi> Surpriz'd above Meaſure at
the Sight of a Perſon, for whom I had formerly cheriſh'd ſo great an
Eſteem; I ſtood ſtill at Firſt, like one Thunderſtruck. I cou'd not
forbear queſtioning my own Senſes, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lye to my Eyes, which
aſſur'd me 'twas ſhe. Neither Age, nor Abſence had effac'd her lov'd
<hi>Idea</hi> from my Memory, or ſo much chang'd her Face, but that I
eaſily call'd to mind the Object of my Amorous Deſires. Yet, my
Aſtoniſhment was ſuch at this unthought of Interview, that I had not
Reſolution enough to believe my ſelf. And her Amazement ſeem'd no leſs
than mine: Whilſt neither of us had Power to ſpeak, but ſtood like Fools:
Till I aſham'd longer to loſe my ſelf in ſuch an effeminate Confuſion
of Spirit, firſt broke Silence, not without ſome Rapture and Emotion,
crying out, 
<q rend="inline">"Is it <hi>Daria,</hi> or her <hi>Ghoſt,</hi>

or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon highly wiſh'd for, ne'er to be enjoy'd? It may be true, That
<hi>Cytherea</hi> left her <hi>Heaven,</hi> (as <hi>Virgil</hi> does relate)
and in a <hi>Tyrian</hi> Dreſs, met the <hi>Heroick Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring</hi> of
<hi>Anchyſes</hi> in the Fields, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him with a diſguized Semblance
of Mortality and Human Race, untill her <hi>Heavenly</hi> Voice diſcover'd
that ſhe was a <hi>Goddeſs.</hi> So us'd <hi>Diana</hi> to deſcend in

ſtealing ſoft Kiſſes from the lovely Youth, and whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Coeleſtial</hi> Words into his Ears, more forcible than the Songs of
<hi>Orpheus,</hi> when he mov'd the Trees and Rocks to Paſſions of
<hi>Platonick</hi> Love. At other Times they wou'd come down and take the Air
of cool Mount <hi>Haemus,</hi> or the lofty <hi>Ida.</hi> Thus <hi>Melpomene,
Clio,</hi> and the Reſt o'th' <hi>Sacred Nine,</hi> wou'd often viſit the
Refreſhing Heights of their belov'd <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſus,</hi> from whence
deſcending to the Shady Banks of <hi>Helicon,</hi> with more than Mortal
Voices, wou'd awake and tempt the wanton <hi>Eccho's</hi> to ſtrike up, like

chant the Praiſes of ſome <hi>Demi-God</hi> or <hi>Hero</hi> whom they
love. But that a <hi>Goddeſs, Nymph,</hi> or <hi>Muſe</hi> did e'er
frequent the <pb n="54" facs="tcp:102964:40"/>Common Crowd of Mortals in a City, is not to
be credited. Therefore, unleſs I dream, it is <hi>Daria</hi> I
behold."</q>
               </p>
               <p>My <hi>Dgnet,</hi> I was running on in higher Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtafies, at
mentioning of her Name, but that ſhe ſmil'd, and interrupted me with an
obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Reſervedneſs, and ſaid; 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Mahmut,</hi> if you are the Man I take you
for, and wou'd have my Eſteem, be leſs paſſionate, and leave off this
wild way of Raillery. We both are paſt the Vanities of Youth. Our Years
ſhou'd now retain no Remnant Froths of early boiling Blood, and Young, Green,
Fooliſh Paſſions."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I took this onely for a Female Banter, an Eſſay of Woman's
Craft, to try the Senſe and Humour of a Man. For, thou knoweſt, the
greateſt <hi>Princeſs</hi> loves a truly paſſionate Addreſs; though
not a puling, whining one. Beſides, 'tis the Faſhion here in
<hi>France,</hi> to uſe <hi>Romantick</hi> Forms of Speech, when they make
Love. However, in Regard it was Inconvenient to loſe more Time, in the open
Street, by this Sort of Diſcourſe, I invited her to a Houſe, where we
might converſe with more Freedom. She accepted the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I conducted
her to the Houſe of <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew.</hi> 'Tis pleaſantly
ſeated on the Banks of the River <hi>Seine,</hi> and has a fair Garden
belonging to it. <hi>Eliachim</hi> happen'd to be abroad, which gave us a
better Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of improving our Time, without the neceſſary
Interruption of Salutes, Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> uſual in ſuch a
Caſe. And I <pb n="55" facs="tcp:102964:40"/>had the command of his Houſe, as though he
had been there himſelf.</p>
               <p>It being in the heat of <hi>Summer,</hi> I led <hi>Daria</hi>
into a little Shady Green Retreat, in the midſt of the Garden, out of the
Reach of curious Ears, where, under the cool re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Shelter of a
wide-ſpread Beech, we ſate down and call'd to Mind our former Acquaintance
and Friendſhip. <hi>Daria</hi> ſtill retain'd her Native Modeſty and
Prudence. Neither had the external Beauty of her Face ſuffer'd any greater
Detriment, than what befalls the faireſt Roſes, Violets, or other Flowers,
which even in their moſt decayed Eſtate, merit the Character of Amiable
Sweetneſs. However, the Luſtre of her Wit, and Goodneſs of her Humour,
ſupply'd all other Defects.</p>
               <p>I proteſt, my <hi>Dgnet,</hi> it was Impoſſible for me to
ſee, and not to love again, a Perſon, whoſe <hi>Idea</hi> once was ſo
Domeſtick and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to my <hi>Soul.</hi> And I was the more animated to
make my <hi>Court,</hi> when ſhe told me, that ſhe was a <hi>Widow.</hi>
'Twas eaſy to forget, or baniſh from my Thoughts, her former Faithful
Treachery, in acquainting her Husband with my Amour. Love ſoon removes all
puny Obſtacles; 'tis ready, prompt, and dextrous to find Excuſes for the
greateſt Faults a Friend can e'er com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: Much more ingenious to palliate
the <hi>Peccadillo's</hi> of a Miſtreſs. This Generous Paſſion by a
peculiar Force extirpates all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and blots out the <hi>Memoirs</hi> of
paſt <pb n="56" facs="tcp:102964:41"/>Unkindneſſes. It ever ſprings and blooms with
freſh Deſires, young vigorous Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Like to the Palm oppreſs'd
with Weights, it higher grows. 'Twou'd fain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, dilate, and ſtretch
it ſelf to Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. There's no Conſideration, but that of Honour, can
pretend to match, or ſtand in Competition with the Divine Regards of Love.
And yet, the moſt exalted Human Glory often vails to this ſoft Paſſion.
The Conquerours of the World, ſuffer themſelves to be o'ercome by
Women.</p>
               <p>Wonder not therefore, That I who am Fleſh and Blood as well as
other Men, cou'd not now defend my ſelf from fair <hi>Daria</hi>'s
Charms.</p>

               <p>'TIS written in the <hi>Fates,</hi> That Man ſhou'd Once, at
leaſt, be vanquiſh'd by a <hi>Woman</hi> in his Life. But, 'tis my Chance
to be Twice ſubdu'd by one of that Fair Sex. I know not whether I acquainted
thee with the Love I formerly bore to <hi>Daria</hi> a Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>Greek</hi> Lady ſojourning in <hi>Paris.</hi> Neither have I at this
Inſtant an Opportunity to look over the File of my Letters, they being in my

the Sake of a Convenience, which offers it ſelf, of ſending thee a ſmall
<hi>Preſent</hi> of <hi>Watches</hi> and <hi>Oriental Stones,</hi> by a
<hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Merchant</hi> who is juſt departing for
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

               <p>However, if thou art curious to know the Circumſtances of this
Amour I ſpeak of; Our Friend <hi>Oglou</hi> can inform thee of it. In the
mean Time, ſuffer me to vent ſome of my Thoughts concerning Women, and the
Love of them, rooted ſo deeply in our Hearts by <hi>Nature.</hi> None of our
Sex cou'd e'er e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape this gentle Paſſion, it being mix'd and blended in
our very Original <hi>Embryo's,</hi> and <pb n="58" facs="tcp:102964:42"/>after cheriſh'd
with our Mothers Milk. It was the peculiar Myſtery of our Nurſes, by a
Thouſand Female Tricks and Arts of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Tenderneſs, to blow and
kindle up the little Sparks of this Immortal Fire within our Infant
<hi>Souls;</hi> whilſt from their Breaſts we ſuck'd and guzzl'd down
inebriating <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> and <hi>Love-Potions,</hi> more forcible and
dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than thoſe the <hi>Grecian Maids</hi> compound by <hi>Magick</hi>
Rules, when they wou'd captivate ſome Lovely Youth within their Snares. Our
Blood thus fed with early Sympathetick Draughts, becomes the Seminary of a
Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Amorous Inclinations; General, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and volatile Affections,
to that Sex: Till Time and Opportunity fix our looſe Deſires, on ſome
particular <hi>Maid,</hi> whom <hi>Fate</hi> or <hi>Chance</hi> has brought
into our View. At the Firſt Glance, ſhe darts from her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting Eyes the
perfect Image of her <hi>Soul,</hi> which penetrates, like Lightning, our
moſt Interiour Faculties. The ſwift <hi>Idea</hi> ſoon transforms us into
its own Similitude; like melted Wax we take the Momentary Impreſſion of a
Figure, which may laſt as long as we. Or, if we melt again, 'tis but to
receive ſome other Stamp of Love. Thus our whole Life paſſes away in an
Enchanted Circle of Amours.</p>
               <p>However, 'tis the Part of a Wife Man to regulate this
Paſſion, and not ſuffer it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into Dotage. There is much to
be ſaid in Praiſe of Women, and not a little in their Diſparagement. As
we are <hi>Riddles</hi> 
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:102964:42"/>to our ſelves, ſo <hi>that
Sex</hi> is in a higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, <hi>Myſterious,</hi> and a
<hi>Paradox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Twou'd be a Kind of Sacrilegious Envy to conceal their
Excellencies, and the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they have of us, in many Regards, whilſt
our partial Pen ſhall onely publiſh their Defects and Infirmities. Some
<hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> from the Different Names of <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> draw Arguments to prove the Dignity and Perfection of the
<hi>Female Sex,</hi> in that <hi>Adam</hi> ſignifies <hi>[Earth]</hi> but
<hi>Eve</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes <hi>[Life.]</hi> For, they affirm, that every Name
which <hi>God</hi> impos'd on any Thing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes its <hi>Nature</hi> and
<hi>Qualities,</hi> as a <hi>Picture</hi> repreſents the <hi>Original.</hi>
Therefore, by how much, <hi>Life</hi> is more to be eſteem'd than
<hi>Earth,</hi> by ſo much more Excellent, in the Opinion of theſe
<hi>Rabbi's,</hi> is <hi>Woman</hi> than <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They go farther alſo, and from the Affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between
<hi>Eve</hi>'s Name and the <hi>Sacred</hi> Name of <hi>God,</hi> the Ineffable
<hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> the <hi>Cabbaliſts</hi> borrow Proofs in
Confirmation of their <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know not, whether ſuch Critical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations be of any
Moment, or no, in this Caſe; Yet, thou know'ſt, that all the
<hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern</hi> Languages are full of hidden Myſteries; each Word and
Letter being impregnated with ſome <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Natural</hi>
Secret, beſide the common obvious Sence. Thus <hi>Al Zerbi,</hi> the Holy
<hi>Muſſulman Doctor</hi> ſays, There's Magick in the Sacred Name of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> and that whene'er it ſhall be once pronounc'd through the
Great Tube or Trump of <hi>Michael,</hi> it <pb n="60" facs="tcp:102964:43"/>ſhall cauſe
all the <hi>Powers</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> in <hi>Earth,</hi> and
<hi>Hell,</hi> to bow the Knee. This <hi>Globe,</hi> whereon we tread, ſhall
tremble, and all the <hi>Elements</hi> melt away; the <hi>Firmament</hi>
ſhall be ſnatch'd up, like to the Motion of an <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Antiport,
Veil, or Curtain. The wide-ſtretch'd <hi>Orbs</hi> Above, ſhall warp and
rowl together, as a ſcorched Skin, or Piece of Parchment does before a Fire.
So forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will be the Energy of that Tremendous <hi>WORD</hi> by which the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> was made; when <hi>God</hi> deſigns to rend this
Viſible World of ours in Pieces, that he may reveal his Nobler Works, the
Worlds Inviſible and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal. This mighty Frame, on every Side will bow, and
yield, and vaniſh; not able to ſupport the crowding Train and Luſtre of
Immortal Glories, Radiant, Bright <hi>Eſſences,</hi> deſcending in a Body
from the High <hi>Palaces</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the Infinite Solitudes and
Receſſes of the <hi>Omnipotent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou haſt no Reaſon to be ſcandaliz'd at what I write, as
if I were a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Thou ſeeſt I have a <hi>Doctor</hi> of

City, tempt thee to deſpiſe the <hi>Bleſſed Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi>
of whom our <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> ſpeaks ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. How many
<hi>Chapters</hi> in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> do celebrate his Praiſe? I rather
counſel thee to imitate the honeſt <hi>Turcomans,</hi> who are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd

Profligate <hi>Renegades,</hi> or Looſe, Wild <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> who fear
neither <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now I've mention'd that Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Mary, Mother</hi>
of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> of whom the Mighty <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſpeaks
ſuch Venerable Things; it is a fit Occaſion to return from my
Digreſſion, and proceed in relating what the <hi>Jewiſh Rabbi's</hi>
ſay farther in Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Female Sex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They conſider the Order which <hi>God,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the
<hi>Writing</hi> of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> obſerved in the Creation:
<hi>viz.</hi> That among his Works ſome are Incorruptible, and Immortal;
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſubject to Corruption and Change, and that as he began in the
Nobleſt <hi>Species</hi> of the Former, to wit, pure ſeparate
<hi>Spirits,</hi> ſo he ended in the Moſt Illuſtrious of the latter that
is, <hi>Woman;</hi> the laſt of all his Works, and the moſt Perfect of
Compound Beings; for in her are center'd and conſummated the Nature of the
Heavens, the Earth, Air, Fire and Water, with Minerals, Plants, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals,
and whatſoever elſe was made before her. This is the Opinion of ſome
<hi>Hebrew Writers,</hi> who believe, that <hi>God</hi> having made
<hi>Eve,</hi> and then ſurvey'd the <hi>Syſtem</hi> of his Works, found
nothing more Excellent or Divinely fram'd than <hi>Woman.</hi> Therefore in her
he reſted and commenc'd the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> as if his Power and Wiſdom
now were tir'd and <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102964:44"/>foil'd, and that he cou'd not ſtart
the <hi>Idea</hi> of another Creature, more perfect than her. Or, as if he did
not eſteem the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> it ſelf compleat without the laſt
and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd of his Works. For, they hold, it is abſurd to
believe, that <hi>God</hi> wou'd finiſh ſuch a prodigious and admirable
Task, in any mean or abject Thing. They alſo illuſtrate this by a
Similitude, aſſerting, That the World being as it were an Intire Circle, it
follows by a Neceſſary Conſequence, that it was finiſh'd in that Part,
which by the moſt Intimate Union, couples the Firſt Atome to the
Laſt.</p>
               <p>They endeavour to ſtrengthen this by the Common Principle of
<hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, That the End is always Firſt in the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and Laſt in Execution. <hi>Woman</hi> therefore being the Laſt
Work of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is evident, ſay they, that ſhe was the Chief
Deſign and Aim, the <hi>Almighty</hi> had in building this Immenſe Fabrick,
which he firſt furniſhed and adorned with infinite Riches and Delights, and
then introduc'd <hi>her,</hi> as into her Own Native, Proper Palace, there to
reign as Abſolute Queen over all his Works.</p>
               <p>Beſides, they take Advantage from the particular Place of her
Creation, to exalt <hi>her,</hi> in that ſhe was form'd in
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> among the <hi>Angels,</hi> whereas <hi>Man</hi> was made
in the Common Waſte among the <hi>Brutes.</hi> And therefore they ſay,
<hi>Women</hi> have this peculiar Privilege, That when they look down from 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102964:44"/>any Eminent Height or Precipice, they feel no Dizzineſs
or giddy Symptoms in their Head, no Miſt or Dimneſs in their Eyes, being,
as it were, nearer their proper Element, or lofty Birth-Place. Whereas it is
common for Men to be troubled with theſe Accidents in ſuch a Caſe.</p>
               <p>But the moſt prevailing Argument they uſe, is taken from the
Stupendous Beauty of that <hi>Sex,</hi> which, like the finer Sort of Clouds in
Summer, ſeems to engroſs the Splendors of Immortal Light, and ſo reflect
them on the World. How matchleſs is a <hi>Woman</hi>'s Form? What dazz'ling
Majeſty environs her, from Head to Foot? Gaze on her lovely Countenance
without Aſtoniſhment; or fix your Eyes on her's without an Ecſtaſie;
Thoſe Lights which do miſlead the <hi>Morning Stars,</hi> and cauſe the
<hi>Gods</hi> to ramble from their <hi>Heaven,</hi> if what the <hi>Ancient
Poets</hi> ſay, be true. So did <hi>Apollo</hi> for his <hi>Daphne,</hi> and
<hi>Jupiter</hi> for others of that charming <hi>Sex.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need we
wonder at this, ſince the <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Law</hi> it ſelf records, that
<hi>Angels</hi> fell in Love with Admirable <hi>Maids</hi> of <hi>Human
Race,</hi> and took 'em for their Wives, or Concubines, from whom the
<hi>Progeny</hi> of <hi>Giants</hi> came. Thus more Modern <hi>Writers</hi>
teſtify, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Daemons</hi> of all Ranks

for ſome <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Virgin.</hi> Which is no falſe or vain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as
the Incredulous Part of Men wou'd fain inſinuate, but a known Truth,
confirm'd by many Experiences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:102964:45"/>Indeed, ſo admirable is the Figure, Voice,

<hi>her,</hi> and adore the ſtately <hi>Idol.</hi> Every Thing in

               </p>
               <p>Yet, after all, my Brother, they have their dark ſide too,
like the Reſt of Mixed <hi>Beings.</hi> They are the Frontier-Paſſes of
the World Above, and that Below: The Gates of Life and Death; the very Avenues
to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Hell</hi> according as they're us'd. Like Fire
they'll warm and refreſh a Man, if he keep at a due Diſtance; but, if he
approach too near, they'll ſcorch and bliſter him, if not conſume him
quite. Or, like that other <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement</hi> of <hi>Water,</hi> they're very
good and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, whilſt kept within their Bounds, but let 'em once
break down the Banks of Modeſty, they'll threaten all with Ruine. In a Word,
'tis neither ſafe to vex 'em in the leaſt, or humour 'em too much. The
Exceſs of Foudneſs, as well as the Defect of Natural Love, may equally
undoe us. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Generoſity is the onely Method of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

<hi>Dog,</hi> is certainly an <hi>Imp</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> a <hi>Devil</hi>
in Human Fleſh; an Adventitious Plant, pluck'd from the Drery Banks of
<hi>Phlegeton,</hi> or <hi>Cocytus,</hi> and engrafted in our Noble Stock, on
Purpoſe to ruine and deſtroy us. The whole <hi>Tribe</hi> is bound to
curſe him with immortal Execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He induſtriouſly ſeeks and
ſtudies all Occaſions to do Miſchief. His Veins ſure ſtream with
fierceſt Venoms, rather than with Human Blood. The Poyſon of
<hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi> and <hi>Aſps</hi> is under his Tongue, and the Gall of
<hi>Crocodiles</hi> within his Lips. His Lungs breath nothing but Infernal
Smokes; the Spirit <hi>Negidher</hi> times the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:102964:46"/>of his Heart; and his whole Body is a
Den of Fiends, as Foul and Black, as thoſe which guard the Throne of the
Great <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I cou'd have eaſily forgiven his ſly malicious Attempts upon
my Life, and Honour; his Interloping Tricks and Plots, his Calumnies and
Slanders, with all the Train of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Actions: But, that he ſhou'd

<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeph,</hi> is an Injury I cann't put up, or pardon. That Innocent Lady
ne'er deſerv'd ſuch Cruel Unmanly Uſage at his Hands. The Dregs of a
Thouſand bitter Curſes be his Portion to drink in <hi>Hell,</hi> unleſs
he repent of this prodigious Baſeneſs, and make Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

               <p>Thou wilt wonder perhaps, what is <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Crime,
that fills me with ſuch Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Reſentments. Know then, that
<hi>Fati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s Husband, being call'd to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s
Service in the <hi>Wars</hi> of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and for that Reaſon,
forc'd to tarry from her above theſe Fourteen <hi>Moons;</hi> ſhe
entruſted <hi>Solyman</hi> with an Affair of grand Importance, a Matter which
concern'd her Life, Honour, and Welfare in the World. It ſeems ſhe had a
Quarrel with an old <hi>Grecian Hag,</hi> who ſought to proſtitute her to
the Great <hi>Cadi</hi> of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where ſhe lives. This
<hi>Grandee</hi> had by a ſtrange Accident, ſeen <hi>Fatima</hi> in a Bath,
frequented onely by <hi>Women</hi> of <hi>Quality.</hi> However through ſome
neglect of the Servants, he was not ſpy'd himſelf, but went away 
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102964:46"/>deeply in Love. That Paſſion, thou know'ſt, makes
every Body reſtleſs, that is tormented with it. He knew not how to eaſe
himſelf, but by communicating his thoughts to the fore-mention'd
<hi>Grecian</hi> Widow, whom he had often made the Confident of his Amours. The
thorow-pac'd <hi>Bawd</hi> ſoon promis'd him Relief, and that ſhe wou'd
accompliſh his Deſires. However ſhe fail'd and found her ſelf
miſtaken, when ſhe came to tempt the Inviolate Chaſtity of
<hi>Fatima.</hi> For, all her glittering Promiſes, her ſofteſt
<hi>Rhetorick,</hi> cou'd ne'er corrupt a Heart eſtabliſh'd firm in
Vertue.</p>
               <p>Mad at her Repulſe, ſhe ſtudies how to be reveng'd,
conceiving it not impoſſible to bring her Deſigns about by Violence,
ſince Fair Perſwaſions wou'd not do. She frames a Formal Accuſation
againſt <hi>Fatima</hi> before the <hi>Cadi,</hi> taxing her with
<hi>Witchcraft</hi> and other Crimes, upon Oath. The <hi>Cadi</hi> having
learn'd his Leſſon, wou'd not hear the <hi>Cauſe</hi> in open
<hi>Divan;</hi> but pretending Indiſpoſition of Body, caus'd her to be
brought before him in his private Bed chamber. The <hi>Greek</hi> had ready by
her, ſeveral ſuborn'd <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> to depoſe moſt horrid
Things againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Woman. When the <hi>Cadi</hi> profeſſing an
intire Reſpect to <hi>Fatima</hi>'s Husband, ſeem'd to take Pity on her
Circumſtances, and wav'd the farther Proſecution of the <hi>Cauſe</hi>
till another Time, keeping <hi>Fatima</hi> Priſoner in the mean while in his
own <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:102964:47"/>All this was manag'd ſo privately, that no
Body in the Town took Notice of it, ſave an Acquaintance or Two of the
<hi>Grecian</hi> Widow, and <hi>Solyman</hi> our worthy Couſin, who happen'd
to be at <hi>Smyrna</hi> in this very Juncture, among his other Rambles.</p>
               <p>Perſons in Trouble, are willing to fly for Refuge to any
Friend, deſiring their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Fatima,</hi> all in Tears at
ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Change of her Condition, had Leiſure and Opportunity to
ſpeak to <hi>Solyman,</hi> conjuring him to go to certain Intimate Friends of
our <hi>Family,</hi> living in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and tell them her
Circumſtances. Inſtead of this, the Faithleſs Villain goes to her
Husband's Friends at <hi>Tripoli,</hi> telling them the moſt ſhameful and
ſcandalous Things of <hi>Fatima,</hi> his Malice cou'd invent; and that by
her lewd Courſes ſhe had well-nigh ruin'd her Husband; producing at the
ſame Time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Bills</hi> and Letters as from him, whereby he rais'd a
Thouſand <hi>Zequins,</hi> with which the perjur'd Villain's gone no Body
knows whither, to make his broken Fortunes once again, and lay a Foundation for
new Cheats. Whilſt the poor injur'd <hi>Fatima,</hi> is forc'd to bear the
Reproach and Infamy of Things whereof ſhe ne'er was guilty. But, Time I hope
will clear her Innocence, and bring that Curſed Vagabond to Shame.</p>
               <p>I counſell'd him indeed long ago to travel, and ſee the
various <hi>Regions</hi> of the Earth. But, I ne'er advis'd him to load his
<hi>Soul</hi> in ſuch long Voyages with the Guilt of baſe Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102964:47"/>barbarous Malice, Perfidy and other Vices of the blackeſt
Hue. The ſmaller Frailties, Stains, and Blemiſhes of Human Life, are too
great a Burden for a generous Heart to bear without Complaints and Sighs. He
that has but a Spark of Vertue in him, bluſhes for every <hi>Peccadillo</hi>
he commits. If, tempted by good Company, or in Hopes to baniſh Melancholy
Thoughts, he indulge himſelf a larger Draught of Wine, than what is Ordinary,
and ſo inſenſibly boil up his Blood to Irregular Heights and
Superfluities, he's all this while no Body's Foe but his own: He plots no
Miſchief againſt his Friend, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Harmleſs Neighbour, or
Acquaintance. All the Enmity he ſhews is to himſelf, and in his Cups he is
not aware of that. For which Reaſon afterwards, to expiate the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Advances he made to ſelf-Murder; he willingly ſcums off the groſſer
Ebullition of his heated Veins, in penitent weeping: A Flood of Tears runs from
his Eyes, like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Libations,</hi> at the Foot of the <hi>Altar,</hi>
to pacify the Wrath of God; whilſt the ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part evaporates in pious
Sighs and Vows. Thus his Pollution vaniſhes like Smoak, and he is ſoon made
Clean again. And ſo in other Vices 'tis the ſame, with Men diſpos'd to
Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. They endeavour to root out the Evil Habits they're accuſtom'd to.
They try all Ways, and Stratagems to reform themſelves. But wicked Men by
Inclination, ſin on without Remorſe. They never ſtudy to retrench the
Evils they commit. Ever propenſe to Vice, <pb n="70" facs="tcp:102964:48"/>they chuſe
its ways, and court the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of doing Impious Things. They're
na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively Unjuſt, and cannot live at Eaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out premeditated Crimes. It
is their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be projecting Miſchief. And ſuch a one is
<hi>Solyman</hi> our Couſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> inſpire him with more Grateful Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
towards his Friends, more Natural and Affectionate to thoſe of his
<hi>Blood,</hi> and a more juſt Deportment to all Men: Or elſe may he be
like <hi>Cain,</hi> who for murdering his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was condemn'd to be a
<hi>Vagabond</hi> on Earth; and like <hi>Zeuli Bazar</hi> the
<hi>Perſian,</hi> who falſely accus'd <hi>Hoſain</hi> the

firſt, in Preſence of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haſt
heard of this or no. Thy Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren perhaps may be unwilling to diſperſe the
News of a <hi>Converſion</hi> bringing ſo much Infamy to all Your
<hi>Race.</hi> 'Tis poſſible they are aſham'd to own or publiſh to the
World, the Tidings of their own Egregious Folly, in giving up their
<hi>Faith</hi> to ſuch a Cheat as this: A Cheat as one wou'd think grown
ſtale and fetid enough, to make a man that had the ſmalleſt Grain of
Sence recoil, conſidering how oft your <hi>Fathers</hi> have been bubbl'd
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by ſuch Upſtart <hi>Meſſiaſſes,</hi> ſuch Spuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Prophets</hi> as this.</p>
               <p>I commend the Wit of <hi>Sabbati Sevi,</hi> in that 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102964:51"/>he would not ſtand the Brunt of the <hi>Grand Signiors
Archers,</hi> or by a vain Preſumption hope for <hi>Miracles</hi> from
<hi>Heaven</hi> to skreen his Naked Body from a Show'r of Fatal Shafts. Had he
been ſo raſh, I ſhould eſteem him the Greateſt <hi>Miracle</hi> of
<hi>Stupidity</hi> that e'er was extant on the Earth. If thou haſt not been
yet informed of theſe Paſſages, Fame will quickly bring them to thy Ears;
and then my Letter will not ſeem obſcure. In the mean Time, aſſure thy
ſelf, he deny'd his <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> to ſave his Life, and this
before the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> with the Chief <hi>Grandees</hi> of the
<hi>Court:</hi> Where, at the ſame Time, he confeſs'd <hi>One God</hi> and
<hi>Mahomet</hi> his <hi>Meſſenger.</hi> If thou art his
<hi>Diſciple</hi> therefore, thou oughteſt to be ſtedfaſt, and tread in
his Steps, giving Glory to the <hi>Eternal One</hi> who has ſent
<hi>Prophets</hi> into all <hi>Nations,</hi> to lead Men in the <hi>Right
Way,</hi> as he ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of
<hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nathan,</hi> ſuffer no Narrow Principles, no Partial
Prejudices to ſhut up thy <hi>Soul</hi> from the bright Splendors of Immortal
Truth, which ſhine on every Man. The Light of <hi>Heaven</hi> is not confin'd
to One particular <hi>Lineage.</hi> 'Tis Copious, large and infinite;
ſpreading abroad its Univerſal Rays, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all the <hi>Families</hi>
and <hi>Nations</hi> on Earth.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, I grant, the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> firſt ſent
<hi>Moſes</hi> with the <hi>Written Law</hi> to the <hi>Poſterity</hi> of

poſſible your <hi>Race</hi> had now been bleſs'd above the Reſt of Men.
Perhaps your <hi>Fathers</hi> would have ſtretch'd their <hi>Conqueſts</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:102964:52"/>far and wide to the utmoſt Limits of the <hi>Land;</hi>
from <hi>India</hi> to the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Shores of <hi>Africk,</hi> and
from the Remote Borders of the <hi>South</hi> to <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> in the
<hi>Artick</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Then devout Princes wou'd have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd from the
<hi>Four Angles</hi> of the World, and made long <hi>Pilgrimages</hi> to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there to perform their <hi>Vows,</hi> and offer
<hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But alas your <hi>Anceſtors</hi> turn'd <hi>Infidels</hi> and
<hi>Idolaters,</hi> even at the very Foot of <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> whilſt
the Tremendous <hi>Eccho's</hi> of the <hi>Thunders</hi> yet were in their
Ears. They made themſelves a <hi>Calf</hi> of <hi>Gold,</hi> and Ador'd the
<hi>Idol</hi> of their own Workmanſhip: So did their <hi>Children</hi>
worſhip <hi>Adonis, Venus, Diana,</hi> and almoſt all the <hi>Rabble</hi>
of the <hi>Gentile Gods,</hi> and <hi>Goddeſſes.</hi> For which Reaſon,
the Wrath of <hi>Heaven</hi> was kindled againſt that <hi>Generation:
God</hi> rowz'd the Mighty <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to take up
Arms and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch a <hi>Wicked Race</hi> of Men. How oft was Fair
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſack'd, and all the <hi>Jews</hi> deſtroy'd or carried
away <hi>Captives</hi> by <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Medes, Aſſyrians,</hi> or the
<hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi> How many <hi>Prophets</hi> were ſent to
tell 'em of their Errours and reclaim 'em? But the Obdurate Sons of
<hi>Jacob</hi> ſtop'd their Ears, being reſolutely bent on Wickedneſs;
the Meaſure of which being once complete, <hi>Fate</hi> ſign'd the
<hi>Edict</hi> of your Utter Ruine. For then came <hi>Jeſus</hi> the
<hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> the True <hi>Meſſias,</hi> who foretold the
Irrevocable <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which came to
paſs <pb n="79" facs="tcp:102964:52"/>accordingly in that very Age; When the Victorious
<hi>Roman</hi> Army laid it all in Aſhes, not ſo much as ſparing the
Glorious <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Ever ſince which, the
<hi>Jews</hi> have been diſpers'd abroad through all the Earth. Each
<hi>Nation, City,</hi> or <hi>Province</hi> where ye live, account ye Execrable
<hi>Fugitives</hi> and <hi>Vagabonds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean while, the Fame of <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpread abroad;
his Heavenly <hi>Doctrine,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Life, and Mighty Miracles, ſubdu'd
the Hearts of Men. <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> took Root i'th' World: It grew, and
branch'd it ſelf through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Continent.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> and
the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Empires</hi> tamely ſat down under the <hi>Church</hi>'s
Shade within Three Hundred Years; and quickly after, other Nations fied unto
the <hi>Sacred</hi> Shelter. But in proceſs of Time this <hi>Religion</hi>
alſo, like to yours, degenerated into Error, Superſtition, and Idolatry.
And then <hi>God</hi> rais'd up <hi>Mahomet,</hi> our <hi>Holy Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</hi>
He ſent him down the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> by the <hi>Hand</hi> of
<hi>Gabriel;</hi> And commanded him to teach it to the <hi>Houſe</hi> of
<hi>Iſmael</hi> firſt, and then to all Men that were willing to embrace the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndefiled Faith;</hi> but to chaſtiſe with Fire and Sword, the
<hi>Infidels</hi> who ſhou'd oppoſe his <hi>Miſſion,</hi> and
reſiſt the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How ſoon the <hi>Muſſulman Law</hi> took Place, and gained
Ground in <hi>Arabia, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Syria,</hi> and the Adjacent <hi>Regions</hi>
of the <hi>Eaſt?</hi> Nothing was able to ſtand before the Warlike Troops
of <hi>True Believers.</hi> How <pb n="80" facs="tcp:102964:53"/>Bold and Matchleſs were
the Actions of the Valiant <hi>Hali?</hi> How wiſe the Counſels of Sage
<hi>Omar,</hi> and <hi>Abu-Bacre?</hi> How Eloquent and Forcible the Words of
the Chaſt and Generous <hi>Oſman?</hi> The <hi>Prophet</hi> was happy in
the Company of all the <hi>Holy Caliphs.</hi> They fought and conquer'd all
before them.</p>
               <p>Whene'er the Heavenly <hi>Banner</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd,
Trembling and Horrour ſeiz'd the <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels.</hi> Showers of
ſucceſsful Arrows ſtreight were ſent, 'gainſt which the

ſuſtain the near Approach and dreadful Shock of our Invlncible Cavalry.
Their faint Battalions quickly ſhrunk and poſted from the Field; whilſt
Ours unmindful of the Spoil, purſu'd the Chace, and ſtrew'd the ground with
ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd Carcaſſes of flying Miſcreants. Conqueſt attended the
<hi>True Faithful,</hi> whene'er they drew their Swords. Thus for above theſe
Thouſand Years has our Religion made its fortunate Advances on the Earth: And
it another <hi>Law</hi> ſhou'd be reveal'd, and ſome New <hi>Prophet</hi>
riſe to check the farther Growth of <hi>Muſſulman Faith,</hi> and
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>Faithful;</hi> we ought not to
reflect on <hi>Mahomet</hi> for this, as tho' he were an <hi>Impious
Seducer,</hi> any more than we do on <hi>Moſes</hi> for your Calamities; or
on <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> for the declining State
of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not impoſſible, but that the <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> may
have hidden Reſerves of <hi>Precepts,</hi> yet to be divulg'd. He has had his
various <pb n="81" facs="tcp:102964:53"/>Methods and Diſpenſations in all Ages and Parts
of the World. Neither is it fit for Mortal Man to limit the <hi>Eternal
One,</hi> or ſet him Rules. His Methods are to us Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. He
ſent <hi>Moſes,</hi> a Man bred up in all the Sciences and Wiſdom of the
<hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi> To <hi>Jeſus</hi> he committed his hidden Power and
Knowledge; and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpake all <hi>Languages.</hi> But
<hi>Mahomet</hi> cou'd neither Write nor Read, and yet thou ſeeſt his
<hi>Law</hi> has proſelyted many Mighty <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, States,</hi> and
<hi>Empires.</hi> Who knows, but that in Future Times he will convert the
<hi>Apoſtate World</hi> by ſome <hi>Dumb Perſon,</hi> who can neither
Hear nor Speak? Or by ſome Blind Man who cou'd never ſee? Or it is not
Impoſſible, but that he may employ ſome <hi>Maid</hi> of Admirable

<hi>Immortal</hi> Wind, the pregnant <hi>Virgins</hi> ſoon conceiv'd deep
<hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> which they writ down on Leaves of Trees:

gather'd up the ſcatter'd Leaves whereon they writ their <hi>Prophecies,</hi>
and tranſcrib'd them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on Paper; that ſo the <hi>Sacred

               </p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid, <hi>Nathan,</hi> thou may'ſt perceive,
That I aim at nothing elſe, but to wean thee from the Superſtitious fond
Conceit of your <hi>Nation;</hi> and to make thee ſenſible, That though
<hi>God</hi> once favoured the <hi>Jews</hi> with <hi>Oracles</hi> of
<hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> yet they have for many <hi>Ages</hi>
forfeited this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege. Since which he gave the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to
<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to
<hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> and at all Times has ſent <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and
<hi>Prophets</hi> to every Nation and People on Earth.</p>
               <p>There are no Partial <hi>Byaſſes</hi> in the
<hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> which made the <hi>Worlds.</hi> He is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible
<hi>Abyſs</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> Where
every <hi>Creature</hi> drinks its <hi>Fill</hi> of <hi>Natural</hi>
Happineſs, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ranks, Capacities and Deſires of
Things. <hi>He Veſts</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> with an <hi>Immortal Robe</hi> of
<hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Train</hi> of which is <hi>born up</hi> by the
<hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Phoebus</hi> is upon the Wing by <hi>Day,</hi> his
<hi>Garment</hi> covers all the <hi>Sky;</hi> the Golden <hi>Fringes</hi> of it
dangle to this <hi>Globe,</hi> and <hi>trail</hi> along i'th' <hi>Miry
Soil,</hi> yet never gather the leaſt <hi>Speck</hi> of <hi>Dirt:</hi>
They're <hi>dipt</hi> and <hi>plung'd</hi> in <hi>Rivers, Lakes,</hi> and
<hi>Seas,</hi> without being <hi>wet;</hi> and yet they <hi>drink</hi> up
<hi>all</hi> the <hi>Ocean,</hi> by <hi>Succeſſive Draughts.</hi> This
Lower <hi>World</hi> rejoices in the <hi>glittering</hi> Shew; the
<hi>Elements,</hi> 
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:102964:54"/>with every <hi>Being</hi> compounded of
them, <hi>bask</hi> in the welcome <hi>Rays.</hi> So do the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi>
Above, who take a ſingular Pride, to <hi>fold</hi> ſome <hi>Part</hi> of
the <hi>Illuſtrious Dreſs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. They <hi>wrap</hi> themſelves
<hi>half</hi> up in <hi>borrow'd Light,</hi> and then like <hi>Weſtern
Franks,</hi> they foot it to and fro', in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Walks Above; giving
the neceſſary Salutes and <hi>Conge's</hi> to each other, <hi>en
Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,</hi> and to the Sedentary <hi>Signs</hi> and Fixed
<hi>Stars,</hi> to ſee if any of them mind their <hi>Courtly</hi> Garb and
Mien: For they are the Sun's <hi>Domeſtick Pages,</hi> the
<hi>Favourites</hi> of <hi>his Serail.</hi> At other Seaſons they ſtand
ſtill, perhaps to gaze upon themſelves, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the
Majeſtick Figure they make.</p>
               <p>So have I ſeen a proud conceited <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trumpeter,
after he'd blown a <hi>Levet</hi> pretty well, lay down the Silver Inſtrument
with a Diſdainful Gravity. His Cheeks all ſwoln with enclos'd Air, and Soul
puff'd up with Arrogance, he ſtruts and curls his Black <hi>Muſtaches.</hi>
Then with big Looks ſurveys himſelf from Head to Foot; caſting an Eye of
Scorn upon the Silent <hi>Tube,</hi> conſcious that he alone can make it
ſound ſo well.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt ſay I wander in my Diſcourſe, as much as thoſe
<hi>Heavenly Bodies</hi> I'm ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. 'Tis true, <hi>Nathan,</hi> our
Thoughts are free, and not confin'd to Rules and Forms. We eaſily ſlip from
one Imagination to another. And ſince I've made this <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary</hi>
Digreſſion, ſuffer me now like them <pb n="84" facs="tcp:102964:55"/>to run
Retrograde, and come to the Point from which I rov'd.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, each Individual <hi>Being</hi> is fill'd with its
<hi>Eſſential</hi> Blifs. The Fire has its Specifick Happineſs; ſo has
the Air, the Water, and the Earth, with all the Living Generations on it. And
when the <hi>Moſt High</hi> diſtributed the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>Humane
Race</hi> through all the Various Climates, Zones, and Provinces, he
furniſh'd every Region of the Globe with Gifts and Products, Riches and
Delights Agreeable to the Inhabitants: With this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That they
ſhou'd live in Innocence, Juſtice and according to Reaſon. From which
Eternal Law if any People ſwerv'd, they ſhould forfeit theſe Privileges,
and be ſubdu'd if not extirpated, by ſome more Vertuous Nation.</p>
               <p>From hence ſprung all the Revolutions of Mighty
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires;</hi> one ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſupplanting
another to this Day. And the Sins of your <hi>Nation</hi> being greater, it
ſeems, than thoſe of any other, <hi>God</hi> has diſpers'd you over all
the Earth, without ſuffering you to inherit or poſſeſs a Foot of
Ground.</p>
               <p>If ever therefore <hi>Fate</hi> deſigns to reſtore the
<hi>Jews</hi> again to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> wherein their <hi>Fathers</hi>
liv'd; never expect it, till your Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Minds, and Vicious Manners are
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. For, <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was never ſeated ſo deliciouſly, for
Bloody Zealots, Hypocrites and Cruel Uſurers to enjoy.</p>

               <p>I will not make thee ſick with a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Rehearſal of my
ſecond Folly in being ſo fond of one who had betray'd me formerly. I'll not
repeat the vain Addreſſes I made, the Kind obliging Things I ſpoke, nor
her deceitful Anſwers. I will not tell thee, how ſhe drill'd me on into her
Snares, and led me Captive in an Amorous Circle; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thy ſelf to know,
that I've been <hi>Twice</hi> her <hi>Cully;</hi> and if e'er I am the

No, my <hi>Dgnet,</hi> I've done with that <hi>Falſe Sex.</hi> Henceforth for

ſome Benefit. I've learn'd a Secret, which has rid my Spirit of a Thouſand
Cares, Diſquiets, and Agonies.</p>
               <p>In the Year 1664 of the <hi>Chriſtians He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gira,</hi> I ſent
a Letter to the Noble <hi>Kerker Haſſan, Baſſa,</hi> our Countryman;
Wherein I inform'd him of an Aſſaſſine made upon me in the Dark, as I
was going to my Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and how I kill'd the Ruffian that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted on my
Life. I told that Generous <hi>Grandee,</hi> all my Jealouſies, and
Conjectures on that Subject; how I ſuſpected ſome of my Enemies at the
<hi>Port,</hi> to have a Hand in the Deſign; or elſe, that my <hi>Sicilian
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> was concern'd in't. I knew not well what to conclude. But, now
I'm ſatisfied 'twas <hi>Daria</hi>'s Husband, who reſenting deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my
former Amour with her, which ſhe diſcover'd to him at large, cou'd never be
at Reſt, till he ſaw <hi>Paris,</hi> where he deſign'd to be the
Executioner of his own Revenge, and lay in wait accordingly for my late
Return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Home: For he was not ignorant of my Lodging. His Wife knew nothing
of his Deſign, he having pretended other Buſineſs at the City. And 'twas
from Accidental Words in her Diſcourſe, that I collected this 
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:102964:56"/>great Secret. For, when I asked her of her Husband's
Health, ſhe told me, he was kill'd at ſuch a Time, by Night, in an Alley of
<hi>Paris,</hi> by whom ſhe never yet cou'd learn. But, I ſtraight
bluſh'd with Conſciouſneſs, and took the Hint. I drop'd ſome
Neceſſary, Careleſs <hi>Queries</hi> by Degrees: And all her Anſwers
ſtill confirm'd me, as to Time and Place, with other Circumſtances, That he
muſt be the Man I murder'd in my own Defence, ſo long agoe.</p>
               <p>I kept this Secret lock'd up in my Breaſt; nor cou'd my doting
Fondneſs melt me into ſuch a ſoft and eaſy Temper, as to betray my
ſelf to her. But I took inward Pleaſure at the Thoughts of my Deliverance
from that ſudden violent Death; and from my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Cares and Fears, by this
Diſcovery. Henceforward I'll ſuſpect no <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> though my
Enemy. Nor ſhall I be ſo fearful of my <hi>Sicilian Maſter.</hi> No
Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Terrours ſhall confine me to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and make me ſpend my
Days in fretting and conſuming Melancholy. I will not be ſurpriz'd, when
Strangers knock at the Gate, or when I hear the Bluſtering Voices of the
Pariſh Officers below, or the Collectors of the King's Revenues. Yet, theſe
before were dreadful as the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s <hi>Atteſcheriff,</hi> or
<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Warrant,</hi> when he demands a <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Head. So
forcible is Jealouſy, and ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Thoughtfulneſs; ſo black the

he often trips and ſtumbles at Contingencies; he ſtrays about in Thorny,
Rugged Paths, not knowing where he is, or which Way to turn himſelf.
Sometimes an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> with its deceitful Light, miſ-guides him
into Miry Places, Fens and Bogs, where he's in Danger of being ſwallow'd up;

               <p>LAſt Year I gave thee an Account of the Birth of a young
<hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> Now I ſhall inform thee, That ſhe
was <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz</hi>'d on the 21ſt. of this <hi>Moon. Baptiſm</hi> with the
<hi>Nazarenes,</hi> is Equivalent to our <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> Nay, 'tis
ſomething more <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> if we may believe them. They call it the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> of <hi>Initiation,</hi> the <hi>Firſt My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of
<hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> But, when 'tis apply'd to Children of
<hi>Royal</hi> Extraction, the Sons or Daughters of <hi>Kings.</hi> it looks
more like a <hi>Ceremony</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> than a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> of
<hi>Religion.</hi> However, be it what it will, 'tis perform'd with Abundance
of Pomp and Magnificence. And at this <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> it is, that every
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> receives his <hi>Name,</hi> which is given by the
<hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers,</hi> that is, Perſons who ſtand
<hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> for the Child's Education in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion.</hi> This <hi>Princeſs</hi> was nam'd <hi>Maria Thereſa,</hi> by
the <hi>Dutcheſs Dowager</hi> of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and by the <hi>Duke</hi>
of <hi>Enguien.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the ſame Day the <hi>Cardinal Duke</hi> of

<hi>Queen,</hi> in Quality of <hi>Legate de Latere</hi> from the <hi>Pope.</hi>

the <hi>Servant</hi> of the <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> A fine Piece of
<hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Hypocriſie!</hi> The Ways of theſe <hi>Infidels</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There has been a great Alteration lately made in

compell'd their <hi>King</hi> to renounce his <hi>Government,</hi> and conferr
it on <hi>Dom Pedro,</hi> his Brother. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> laughs at this
privately, hoping from their Inteſtine Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities to draw Occaſions of
advancing his own Intereſt, and of recovering that <hi>Crown</hi> again.</p>
               <p>Accompliſh'd <hi>Miniſter,</hi> There is Nothing New under
the <hi>Moon;</hi> but a perpetual Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the ſame Events. What we admire
at <pb n="91" facs="tcp:102964:58"/>in this Age, as a Novelty, has been acted o'er and o'er
in former Times. Peace follows War, and War treads cloſe upon the Heels of
Peace. Faith, Perfidy, Sedition, Obedience, Vertue and Vice, are the
Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal Off ſpring of each other. There's nothing fix'd or ſtable; but
the World turns round upon Eternal Viciſſitudes.</p>

Doubtleſs, there is no Blemiſh in his Works: No Botches, Knobs, or

               <p>Were <hi>Ptolomy</hi> alive, thy <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the

               <p>Thy Thoughts are high and elevated to the <hi>Heaven</hi> of

               <p>Thoſe that have meaſur'd the <hi>Earth,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree
in ſtating her Circumference: And there were few in former Times who did

they are <hi>Allegories,</hi> under which are veil'd ſome True and Natural

               <p>However, let the <hi>Globe</hi> reſt where it will, on

as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did affirm; I wou'd fain know, methinks, how large a
Space of Land we have to tread upon, and what Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is allotted to the

               <p>'Tis true, we have a Common Notion of <hi>Four Quarters</hi> of

               </p>
               <p>There is a Vulgar Tradition, every where in Vogue, That after

his <hi>Poſterity; Afrique</hi> to <hi>Cham,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> to
<hi>Japhet.</hi> Whether this be true or no, cannot be prov'd, but is wholly
owing to Conjecture. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this is certain, That if it were ſo, there
have been mighty Changes in the Inheritances of <hi>Noah</hi>'s
<hi>Off-ſpring;</hi> and Alterations of their ſeveral Limits: Inſomuch,
as now they ſeem to be in Part blended and mix'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at leaſt,
ſhuffl'd from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who liv'd in the <hi>Middle Ages,</hi> made but <hi>Two
Diviſions</hi> of the <hi>Globe;</hi> Viz. <hi>Aſia</hi> and
<hi>Europe:</hi> And in this they alſo differ'd: For, ſome made

                  <hi>Province</hi> or Part of the

afterwards ſeparated by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Irruption of the <hi>Atlantick Sea,</hi>
by the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Gibralter,</hi> which before was a Narrow
<hi>Iſthmus</hi> or Neck of Land; but from the Time that Bank was waſhed
away, the <hi>Mediterranean Sea</hi> deriv'd its Origin. Others made
<hi>Africk</hi> a Part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> they being not abſolutely parted
by any <hi>Sea;</hi> though ſome <hi>Egyptian Kings,</hi> and <hi>Roman
Emperours,</hi> attempted to make a <hi>Canal</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
<hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Red Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Third</hi> Sort divided the Known Part of the World into
<hi>Aſia, Europe, Africk,</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> Whilſt a <hi>Fourth</hi>
plac'd <hi>Egypt</hi> to the Account of <hi>Aſia,</hi> making the River
<hi>Nile</hi> the Boundary between it and <hi>Africk.</hi> But this was
Incommodious, in Regard it left that of <hi>Egypt</hi> on the <hi>Weſt</hi>
of <hi>Nile,</hi> to <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca.</hi> Such was the Confuſion of the Ancient
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Geographers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>America,</hi> it takes its Name from <hi>Americus
Veſputius,</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> who made the Second Voyage to

ſlipt off the Stage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as taking his Leave.</p>
               <p>The Aſtronomers ſoon fell in Love, and pay'd Implicite
Adoration to the Idol which <hi>Copernicus</hi> ſet up. And 'twas but
Reaſon; ſince, they had never ſeen a fairer or a juſter Scheme of the
World before.</p>
               <p>Yet every Age improves it ſelf in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, on the Ruines of
the Former. And thus, what <hi>Ptolomy</hi> ne'er found out, nor <hi>Tycho
Brahe</hi> or <hi>Copernicus</hi> cou'd mend or match, if now they were alive;
is very late diſcover'd by the Incomparable <hi>Abdel Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec Muli Omar,</hi>
Preſident of the College of Sciences at <hi>Fez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Happy <hi>Muſu Abu'l Yahyan,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of
<hi>Philoſophy</hi> there, firſt ſtarted the Propoſal of a
<hi>Mathematical</hi> Experiment. And, laying Heads together, the Primate of
<hi>Moreſco</hi> Doctors, Father of all the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Alfaqui's</hi>
living, found a true <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>I have lately receiv'd a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> from that Renowned
Prelate, with an encloſed Model of this Planetary Machine. A Copy of which I
ſend thee, drawn by my own Hand. It repreſents the Original to a Point.
Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it well and thou wilt find, 'tis much more regular and exact than any
of thoſe Antiquated Schemes, and anſwers all the Queſtions of
<hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> without the leaſt <pb n="100" facs="tcp:102964:63"/>apparent
Blunder. Beſides, it has a perfect Symmetry and Proportion in every Part: it
makes the World appear a compleat Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Whereas the Frame which <hi>Tycho
Brahe</hi> made, was all deform'd with wild Uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Nor was the
<hi>Syſtem</hi> of <hi>Copernicus</hi> without a manifeſt Botch, in making
the ſmall <hi>Orb</hi> o'th' <hi>Moon</hi> alone, to interfere with that
o'th' <hi>Earth:</hi> Whilſt all the other <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> circulate in
their own entire and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Spheres,</hi> without an Interloper to
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb 'em.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he makes the Earth an <hi>Atlas</hi> to the
<hi>Moon,</hi> whilſt this poor weary <hi>Globe</hi> is forc'd, in his
Opinion, to drudge yearly round the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> with the vaſt Burden of
<hi>Diana</hi> on its Shoulders.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo, it is no wonder that the Earth ſo often faints
and trembles under the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Load. Henceforth we need not lay the Blame of
<hi>Earthquakes</hi> to <hi>Enceladus,</hi> as if the drowzy; ſnoring
<hi>Gyant,</hi> turning his monſtrous Bulky Corps from one Side to the other,
were the Sole Cauſe of theſe Convulſions: When Mortals reel and ſtagger
as they walk upon the Surface; when Trees and Mountains rock, as in a Cradle,
and whole Cities are ſometimes ſwallow'd up.</p>
               <p>No; let poor <hi>Enceladus</hi> ſleep on, and take what Reſt
he can in his <hi>Infernal</hi> Priſon. There was no Danger of his e'er
ſtirring again, after he'd once been thorowly ſowc'd in <hi>Lethe</hi>'s
all-benumming Streams. <hi>Copernicus</hi> is onely in the Fault: Whene'er we
feel theſe <pb n="101" facs="tcp:102964:63"/>Fatal Heavings of the <hi>Globe,</hi> 'twas
too unmerciful a Task he impos'd upon it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in its Old Age.</p>
               <p>It wou'd have grumbled in its early Days and ſturdy Youth, had
it been thus ſeverely us'd by <hi>Orpheus, Homer, Hermes,
Triſmegiſtus,</hi> or any other of the Primitive Sages. But now to be thus
roughly handl'd by an Upſtart Infidel in its declining Years, when Three
Parts of its Marrow's decay'd, and its once potent Nerves and Sinews are
ſhrunk, its Liver waſted, and every Vital dwindling away; almoſt broke
its Heart.</p>
               <p>Therefore theſe <hi>African</hi> Sages, in Duty to their aged
Mother the Earth, have found a Way to free her from the Burden of the
<hi>Moon</hi> in her decrepid State; and yet to make the <hi>Sun,</hi> the
<hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> adjuſting at the ſame Time, with
accurate Laws, and an Unblemiſh'd Order, the Motions, Stations, and various
Poſtures of the <hi>Planets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Happy Revelation in <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> is not to be
divulg'd in Publick Writings; leſt ſome Inquiſitive Curious Traveller,
Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Nazarene</hi> or Envious <hi>Jew,</hi> ſhou'd chance to light
upon the Sacred Scheme, and boaſt himſelf the Inventer of it.</p>
               <p>Let it be onely communicated to Learned, Faithful
<hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> of the Firſt Rank: For, ſuch <hi>Celeſtial</hi>
Myſteries, ought not to be proſtituted to the Vulgar. Tell not the little
<hi>Jaſmir Sgire Rugial</hi> of it. For, if thou doſt, all the
<hi>Frank</hi> Merchants at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> ſoon ſhall be made privy to
the matchleſs <pb n="102" facs="tcp:102964:64"/>Secret. Be it a perpetual <hi>Arcanum</hi>
in the Breaſts of Sublime Men, exalted Souls; <hi>Friends</hi> of
<hi>God,</hi> and little leſs than <hi>Prophets.</hi> And be it ſo, till
all the Sages of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> are firſt made
ſenſible of it, and able to defend it, againſt the vain Attempts of the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed</hi> Nation. Then let it be promulg'd in <hi>Alla</hi>'s

Glory of his Prophet, who cou'd neither write nor read, yet has Diſciples to

               </head>
               <p>THE Orders of thy <hi>Sanctity,</hi> came like a Meſſage
from <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſurprizing me at once, with equal Pleaſure and
Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Every Line encreas'd my Rapture. And now I thought, I had no
more to wiſh for in the World, ſince the Great <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the
<hi>Faithful,</hi> had condeſcended to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Advice of ſo mean a
Slave as <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut.</hi> It has been my paſſionate Deſire, to ſee
Knowledge flouriſh in the Renowned <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> that the
<hi>Infidels</hi> may no longer reproach us with Ignorance and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm.
This was the Reaſon, that I ſo often importun'd thy
<hi>Predeceſſor,</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of
<hi>Hiſtories</hi> into the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language. Now thou art pleas'd
to begin this Glorious Work, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me, by requiring my Inſtructions
in the Management of it. Nay, thou haſt commanded me, to lay the Foundation
of ſo Illuſtrious an Enterprize, in preſenting thee a Pattern or Model of
this <hi>Great Work,</hi> containing an <hi>Hiſtorical Epitome</hi> of the
<hi>Four</hi> 
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:102964:65"/>Great <hi>Monarchies,</hi> with a brief
<hi>Series</hi> of the moſt Remarkable and Famous Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Changes,
and other Events in the World, with Reference to the <hi>Nation</hi> and
<hi>Age</hi> wherein they happen'd.</p>
               <p>As to the Advice thou demandeſt of me, I think it wou'd be for
the Honour and Benefit of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> That a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> ſhould be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected out of the
moſt Ancient and Sincere <hi>Writers,</hi> and digeſted into
<hi>Annals,</hi> from the very Beginning of Time, down to the <hi>Reign</hi> of
our preſent <hi>Emperour,</hi> the Auguſt Sovereign of the Whole Earth:
That ſo, whatſoever has been done on Earth worthy of Memory, may be rank'd
in its proper Time and Place; and we may not grope any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the Dark,
when we would know, in what Year or Age any Famous Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our or Monarch liv'd
or died; or, when any renowned City was built, beſieg'd, taken, and
deſtroy'd, and by whom all theſe Things were done: With many other uſeful
<hi>Memoirs,</hi> in which the <hi>Ottomans</hi> are now wanting.</p>
               <p>In the Beginning of this <hi>Work,</hi> it will be abſolutely
neceſſary, to have Recourſe to the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of the
<hi>Indians, Perſians</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and to the
<hi>Writings</hi> of <hi>Orpheus, Homer, Thales, Zeno,</hi> and others of
<hi>Greece, Phoenicia</hi> and <hi>Thrace.</hi> For, though the
<hi>Nazarenes</hi> of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> deſpiſe the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of
theſe <hi>Authors,</hi> and calumniate all for <hi>Fables</hi> and
<hi>Romances</hi> which was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd <pb n="106" facs="tcp:102964:66"/>before the Firſt
<hi>Olympiad;</hi> yet, the more Impartial Inhabitants of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
whether <hi>Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> reject Nothing which
has the undoubted Stamp of Antiquity; but rather ſeek to unriddle the
Myſterious Expreſſions of the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi>
who ſtrove induſtriouſly to cover all their Knowledge and Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
under dark <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> Figures, and Parables, that ſo the
<hi>Divine</hi> Secrets of <hi>Antiquity</hi> might not be prophan'd, by the
Rude and Unpoliſh'd Vulgar.</p>
               <p>It was ever the <hi>Maxim</hi> of ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Sages</hi>
and <hi>Politicians,</hi> thus to keep the People in Ignorance of paſt Times;
the better to aſſure their Dominion and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them. They onely
reveal'd what was obvious to every Man's Sence, the manifeſt and viſible
Influences of the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Bodies, the Courſe of the <hi>Sun,
Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> the Natures of <hi>Plants</hi> and
<hi>Animals,</hi> with whatſoever elſe was lyable to any Man's Eye and
Apprehenſion. But as to the more obſtruſe and leſs. Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Works of <hi>Nature,</hi> they were like the Secrets of State, kept under a
Veil.</p>
               <p>Yet, there wanted not Men of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in other <hi>Parts</hi>
of the <hi>World,</hi> who ſtrove to unfold all Things, and render Mankind
familiar with whatſoever fell under humane Intellect. Among theſe, the
<hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Chineſes</hi> deſerve the firſt Place, who were
never covetous of the Gifts of <hi>Nature,</hi> but ſought to improve all
thoſe <pb n="107" facs="tcp:102964:66"/>of their <hi>Nations</hi> in the Knowledge of the
<hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences;</hi> and eſpecially, in the <hi>Syſtem</hi>
of Ancient <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> Theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſhut up themſelves from the
Reſt of the World for many Ages; fearing, leſt Commerce might corrupt the
Simplicity of their Primitive Laws and Inſtitutions. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Alexander the
Great,</hi> and before him, <hi>Semiramis</hi> Queen of the
<hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Acceſs to the <hi>Indies</hi> in Old Time.
And <hi>China</hi> was never open till of late, when their too potent
Neighbours the <hi>Tartars,</hi> broke through their famous Wall, and ſubdu'd
the whole <hi>Empire.</hi> And their Buſineſs was not with <hi>Books,</hi>
but with <hi>Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the <hi>Indian
Brachmans</hi> and the <hi>Bonzi's</hi> of <hi>China,</hi> deliver an Account
of the <hi>Origin</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and the next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<hi>Ages</hi> ſo far beyond the <hi>Epocha's</hi> of all other
<hi>Hiſtorians,</hi> eſpecially theſe in the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For Events of later Date, the <hi>Compilers</hi> of this
<hi>Work</hi> may make Uſe of ſuch <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> as have written
the <hi>Annals</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Nations</hi> ſince the Firſt
<hi>Olympiad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou knowſt not what an <hi>Olympiad</hi> means, 'tis the
Form of Computation us'd in the Ancient <hi>Graecian Hegyra,</hi> every
<hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad</hi> containing Four Years. And the firſt of theſe
<hi>Olympiads</hi> began in the Year of the <hi>World</hi> 3228. At which Time
<hi>Choraebus</hi> of <hi>Elis,</hi> ſignaliz'd himſelf-by winning the
Firſt <pb n="108" facs="tcp:102964:67"/>
                  <hi>Race</hi> that ever was run at the
<hi>Olympick Games.</hi> Theſe <hi>Games</hi> were celebrated eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Olympiad;</hi> and all the <hi>Youth</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> flock'd to
them, to try their Skill in Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Wreſtling, and other manly
Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</p>
               <p>About this Time <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> began to write Partially,
and the Truth cou'd hardly be diſcern'd from the Fabulous Errours with which
it was Adulterated. Yet this rather proceeded from a <hi>National</hi>
Emulation, than from a Deſign to corrupt the <hi>Ancient Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi>
However, thou mayſt give Credit to <hi>Thucidydes,</hi> who in the 86th.
<hi>Olympiad</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to write his <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>War</hi> in
<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponeſus,</hi> between the <hi>Lacaedemonians</hi> and thoſe of
<hi>Athens;</hi> which <hi>War</hi> continu'd One and Twenty Years, as that
<hi>Author</hi> teſtifies, who wrote <hi>Annals</hi> of it from the
Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the End. And among other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Paſſages, which he is
very exact in recounting, he mentions a famous <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of the
<hi>Sun</hi> that happen'd in the Firſt Year of that <hi>War,</hi> and was
ſo great that the <hi>Stars</hi> appear'd at Noon day in the <hi>Sky.
Plutarch</hi> alſo ſpeaks of this <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> telling us, that
<hi>Pericles, Prince</hi> of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> being at Sea when the
<hi>Sun</hi> was thus dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd, and perceiving the <hi>Master</hi> of the
<hi>Veſſel</hi> in a great Fright, as at ſome Prodigy; he threw his Cloak
over the Man's Face, and ask'd him, <hi>If he was afraid of that, or look'd
upon it as a had Omen?</hi> And <pb n="109" facs="tcp:102964:67"/>when the <hi>Maſter</hi>
anſwer'd, <hi>No; Pericles</hi> reply'd, <hi>What Difference is there between
this Eclipſe of the Sun and that, ſince both are caus'd by the
Interpoſition of a Veil between the Sun and thine Eyes; onely that Veil is
larger than my Cloak, it being the Moon which covers that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lamp from
our Sight?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much about the ſame Time liv'd <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> and
<hi>Hellanicus,</hi> two famous <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,</hi> Men of Integrity and
Credit, and <hi>Hypocrates</hi> the Renowned <hi>Phyſician</hi> of
<hi>Athens.</hi> Theſe are worthy to be tranſlated into the
<hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, as are alſo <hi>Exnophon</hi> and
<hi>Polybius,</hi> who wrote after them. They all, except the laſt, liv'd in
the Time of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy,</hi> and therefore are moſt likely to
deliver down a true Account of the Memorable Events that happen'd during that
formidable <hi>Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Macedonian Monarchy,</hi> the moſt Eminent
<hi>Writers</hi> were <hi>Curtius, Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus, Diodorus Siculus;</hi> but this
laſt is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently miſtaſten in his <hi>Chronology,</hi> and therefore
ought to be corrected by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo muſt be
conſulted, and <hi>Joſephus</hi> the <hi>Jew;</hi> with <hi>Strabo, Appian,
Livy, Juſtin</hi> and <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> For they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerve to
illuſtrate one another, where they treat of the ſame Matters, or elſe the
one carries on the Thread of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> where the other left off. And
therefore thou need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not wonder that I name ſo many <hi>Authors,</hi> 
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:102964:68"/>ſince they are worthy of Credit, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary to the completing an intire <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the
<hi>World:</hi> Whereas there are a Rabble of other <hi>Writers,</hi> who are
ſcarce worth the Naming; much leſs their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to be truſted to, in
compiling an Univerſal <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> which is to give a new Luſtre to
the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> and raiſe its Credit in the Learned World.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to
make Uſe of <hi>Joſephus, Tacitus, Suetonius, Philo, Xiphilus, Zonaras,
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus Marcellinus, Velleius Paterculus, Seneca, Florus, Livy</hi> and
<hi>Suidas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe will be ſufficient Materials, with which the
<hi>Tranſlators, Scribes</hi> and <hi>Compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> may accompliſh this
Illuſtrious Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; the Encouragement whereof I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain earneſtly

               <p>What concerns the Injunction thou haſt laid on me, to draw a

               <p>THY Sufferings pierce my Heart: I owe thee Pity on the Score of
Humane Nature; and a more Compaſſion as thou art a <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi>
But, where's the Tongue or Pen, that can deſcribe the Sympathy of Friends?
Canſt thou in a deſponding Manner caſt thy ſelf upon thy Bed, there to
exhale, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy <pb n="114" facs="tcp:102964:70"/>Sighs, that pungent Sorrow, which
can find no other Vent, unleſs thoſe Vapours of the Spleen condenſe to
Show'rs of Tears? Canſt thou do this, and I remain Inſenſible all the
while? No! I in a perfect <hi>Eccho</hi> to thy ſaddeſt Groans. And when
thou weep'ſt, my Heart is not a Stone, that ſpatters back again the Drops
that fall on it; but 'tis like Clay, that ſoftens with the Gentle Solemn
Diſtillation. Believe that I ſweat Blood, when thou diſſolv'ſt in
Tears. I am not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Moderation toward my Friend. My Love, my Joy, my
Grief, and Anger, are all Exceſſive, when ſuch a one as thou
occaſion'ſt them. 'Tis equal Pleaſure to live or die, in this Magnetick
Point: For, <hi>Souls</hi> of Friends are perfect <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niſons.</hi> Then,
if thou haſt a Spark of Love for <hi>Mahmut,</hi> do not kill me with thy
ſad Complaints. For, whilſt I hear, that thou art thus abandon'd to
Misfortune and Deſpaſr, how can I live without perpetual Deaths, more
Terrible than what we all muſt undergo, by the Courſe of <hi>Nature?</hi>
Doſt thou delight to make a Conſtant <hi>Martyr</hi> of me?</p>
               <p>Thou 'rt bred a <hi>Courtier,</hi> and ſo was I: Our Infant
Blood was ſeaſon'd with the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s. Bread and Salt: We
equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbib'd the Manners, Habits, Cuſtoms, Maxims, and the Pride of the
<hi>Seraill';</hi> with the Pillow, the Milk, Sorbets, and other Nouriſhment
of our Early Years. Since which we have ſeen the various Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of
Mighty <hi>Kingdoms, States</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.</hi> 
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:102964:70"/>We
have beheld the Invincible <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> of <hi>China</hi> fall a
<hi>Victim</hi> to the Perfidy of his <hi>Slaves,</hi> and to the more
propitious Fortune of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> After another Manner was the Glory
of the <hi>Britiſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> eclips'd. But, no foreign Story can match
the Barbarous Maſſacres of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick <hi>Sultans, Muſtapha,
Oſman,</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim,</hi> all within our Memory.</p>
               <p>Oh! <hi>Mehemet,</hi> we have liv'd too long, after theſe
Spoils of <hi>Royal</hi> Blood. How can we repine at our own Private Loſſes
and Afflictions, whilſt we do but ſip the Flat Inſipid Reliques of
thoſe Tragical, ſprightly Potions, brew'd for the Palates of the
Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>Princes.</hi> Henceforth, let's live, as if we were among the
Dead. Let's hear, and ſee, feel, taſte, and ſmell theſe Outward Objects
<hi>en paſſant,</hi> without being ſenſible what we do or ſuffer. Let
us Anticipate, by a wiſe Prevention, the laſt Stroke of Death, in dying
every Moment.</p>
               <p>Go to the <hi>Pyramids,</hi> my <hi>Mehemet,</hi> or would to
<hi>God</hi> I cou'd go thither for thee; there to Contemplate the Fate of
Humane Glory, the Mock Grandeur of this World. Conſider all the <hi>Race</hi>
of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings, who built theſe Coſtly and Magnificent
Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, or their <hi>Fathers</hi> for 'em: Who fill'd the Hollow Piles
with Silver, Gold and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones: Whilſt, with their Magick Laws, they
liſted Legions of <hi>Spirits,</hi> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Air, Fire, Earth and
Water, obliging them to guard the Wealthy Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: <pb n="116" facs="tcp:102964:71"/>And
tell me then, what thou can'ſt find in thoſe ſuperannuated Vaults?
No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but Stench and Darkneſs. Old <hi>Time</hi> has filch'd away the
ſlighter Glory's of the Place; and his Younger Brother <hi>Avarice,</hi> has
plunder'd all the Reſt, which was the more Subſtantial Part. He cou'd have
done no leſs in Common good Manners, than take the Leavings of the Heir; the
Elder of the Two. The Great <hi>Al Maimun</hi> thought to have the Gleanings of
their Harveſt; but he found, the Gain wou'd ne'er exceed the Coſt.</p>
               <p>But, what's become of all the Founders of theſe
Aſtoniſhing Fabricks? Look in the <hi>Tomb</hi> of <hi>Cheops,</hi> who is
ſuppos'd to build the Greateſt of the <hi>Pyramids;</hi> and thou wilt
find, not the leaſt Relique of his Aſhes: Or, if thou ſhould'ſt 'twill
be Impoſſible to diſtinguiſh them, from the Common Duſt of other
Mortals, tho' his Meaneſt <hi>Slaves:</hi> So Mutable is Human Glory; So
Inconſtant all the Smiles of Fortune.</p>
               <p>Do but reflect on all the Glorious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of
<hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and on the Triumphant Entry he made in
<hi>Babylon,</hi> when the <hi>Chariot</hi> which carry'd him, was an
<hi>Epitome</hi> of all the Riches which the <hi>Indies</hi> cou'd afford; and
yet that <hi>Chariot</hi> ought to be eſteem'd but one Degree before his
<hi>Hearſe,</hi> which in a very few Days, with an Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity beneath the
Merits of ſo great a <hi>Victor,</hi> convey'd him to his Grave.</p>
               <p>Conſider <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who after Four and 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102964:71"/>Twenty Battels, wherein he always got the Day, was drawn
in a triumphant <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot</hi> to the <hi>Capitol,</hi> by Forty Elephants;
yet now his Name is hardly thought of.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Epaminondas</hi> thought to outvye the world in his
Magnificent Inſults; yet all this Glorious Pageantry ended in Duſt and
Aſhes. <hi>Aurelian</hi> led the <hi>Graces</hi> Captive with
<hi>Zenobia;</hi> yet he himſelf at laſt became the Priſoner of Death.
The Pompous Galley of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> when ſhe Celebrated the
<hi>Cilician Triumph,</hi> ſerv'd but to mend the Poop of <hi>Charon</hi>'s
Boat, when ſhe was to be ferry'd to <hi>Elyzium.</hi> So the Proud
<hi>Seſoſtris,</hi> whoſe Coach was drawn by Four Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
<hi>Kings,</hi> at laſt was fain to owe his Uncouth Funeral to Four Sordid
Slaves, who ſtole his Naked <hi>Corps</hi> away from the Deſign'd Revenge
of Factious <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and buryed it in a Heap of <hi>Camel's</hi>
Dung.</p>
               <p>But, where's the Pen or Pencil that will to the Life deſcribe
the Unmatch'd Cavalcade of <hi>Pompey,</hi> when by a proſperous
<hi>Chymiſtry</hi> he had extracted all the Richeſt Spirits and
Eſſences of <hi>Eaſtern</hi> wealth, to grace his Entry into
<hi>Rome?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Front of the <hi>Proceſſion</hi> dazl'd every Eye, with
the ſtrange Luſtre of Diamonds and Carbuncles mix'd in chequer-wiſe: An
<hi>Orental Figure,</hi> or rather the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of all
<hi>Aſia,</hi> in <hi>Epitome.</hi> Then follow'd the Image of the Creſcent
<hi>Moon</hi> in maſſy Gold, with a Train of Mountains of the ſame Metal,
whereon were Woods of Jet, Vines <pb n="118" facs="tcp:102964:72"/>whoſe Grapes were
entire Saphires, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals all of Porphyry, Grazing on Fields of verdant
Amethyſts.</p>
               <p>To ſanctify this Glorious Shew, the Golden Images of
<hi>Jupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> came next in Sight, with Thirty
Crowns of Gold, born up by the Chief Captains of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as if ſo many
<hi>Kingdoms</hi> were deſign'd for their Rewards. And becauſe
<hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddeſſes</hi> ſhould not want a <hi>Temple,</hi>
Five Hundred <hi>Slaves</hi> bore up a <hi>Fane,</hi> built all of Maſſy
Silver, waſhed with Gold. And at the Back of this, appear'd the Statue of the
Conqueror, on which no Eye cou'd fix, being cruſted o'er with Hyacinths and
Pearls.</p>
               <p>Behold, my <hi>Mehmet,</hi> an Exuberance of Humane Glory: Yet
wonder not to ſee a Man come after all; a Mortal Man, I ſay, made Radiant
as the <hi>Sun,</hi> with borrow'd Jewels. And to complete his fading Triumph,
read theſe Letters, all pure Jaſpers, on his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot-Wheels: <hi>Armenia,
Cappadocia, Paphlago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Media, Colchis, Syria, Cilicia, Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,
Phoenicia, Paeleſtine, India,</hi> and the <hi>Deſarts</hi> of
<hi>Arabia.</hi> All theſe were the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of this Triumphant Warriour,
and yet his <hi>Deſtiny</hi> Inſulted over him. Poor <hi>Pompey</hi> thou
art gone, and all thy Mighty Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> are now
poſſeſs'd by <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> our Glorious <hi>Sovereign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what need thou and I repine, after we have ſeen all this?
Let <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Carthage</hi> with the Glory of Four
Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <pb n="119" facs="tcp:102964:72"/>
                  <hi>Triumphs:</hi> Yet that Theatre of his Honour
quickly proves the <hi>Stage</hi> whereon he was degraded, ſtript ſtark
naked, and in Triumph led away by Death. So <hi>Marius,</hi> after he had been
exalted to the Top of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Felicity on Earth, was ſeen all naked lying in a
ſtinking Ditch.</p>
               <p>What is become of <hi>Nero's</hi> Silver Gallery in the Capitol?
Or the pendant Gardens of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> which coſt no leſs than
Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Millions of Gold? Where is now the Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Hall of <hi>Atabalipa,
King</hi> of <hi>Peru,</hi> whoſe Pavement was of <hi>Saphires?</hi> Or the
Gardens of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> fenc'd round with Pales of Gold? Or
<hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Fountains garniſh'd with <hi>Dryads</hi> of the ſame
Metal? Where is the Ivory Palace of <hi>Melaus,</hi> or the Cryſtal
<hi>Louvre</hi> of <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?</hi> All theſe Things are vaniſh'd with
their Founders.</p>
               <p>How Wiſe and Happy then was <hi>Saladine,</hi> the Great and
moſt Invincible <hi>Conquerour</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who Triumph'd o'er
himſelf; and in his Victorious Return, caus'd a Shirt to be carryed before
him on the Point of a Spear, with this Proclamation: <hi>That after all his
Glories, he ſhould carry nothing to the Grave but that poor Shirt?</hi> So
<hi>Adrian</hi> a <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,</hi> to qualify the exceſſive Joys
of his High Fortune, Celebrated his own Funeral, and caus'd his <hi>Coffin</hi>
to be born before him, when he was to make a Publick Cavalcade through
<hi>Rome.</hi> This was a ſacred Triumph, an Heroick Inſult over
<hi>himſelf</hi> and <hi>Death.</hi>

               <p>

               <p>I Lodge in a Houſe near the Wall of <hi>Paris,</hi> which
gives me a daily Opportunity of ſurveying out of my Window, the Adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Fields: Theſe extend themſelves in a Plain, for the Space of a League, or
therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts; And then the Eye is arreſted by a long Ridge of Riſing
Ground, a Row of Hills or Hillocks, not meriting the Lofty Name of Mountains,
yet high enough to put a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley out of ſhape, and make th' <hi>Horizon</hi>
crump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back'd.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Hills are cover'd thick with Woods and Groves; amongſt
whoſe verdant, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Tops, ſome Stately <hi>Palaces</hi> lift up their

               <p>This Proſpect repreſents ſo much to th' Life, the Valley
of <hi>Admoim</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> the Place of my Nativity, that I cou'd
as well graſp Coals of Fire with naked Hand, and not be burnt; as caſt my
Eye out of my Window, on this lovely Landskip, and not be inflam'd with
ſecret paſſions for my <hi>Native</hi> Soil, the Place where I firſt
drew the Vital Air. It is a perfect <hi>Magnet</hi> to my Spirit, whereſoever

ſometimes I ſee the Faces of my <hi>Kindred,</hi> and their Rural Train; I

preſent: Such is the Magick of ſtrong Deſire and Sympathy. It ſteals
the <hi>Soul</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it ſelf, and with ſweet Violence unites it to
the belov'd Object, tho' at never ſo great a Diſtance. Thus when my

               <p>Glory to <hi>Him</hi> that was before <hi>All Time,</hi> the

ſtretch'd in fervent <hi>Oraiſons.</hi> Thy Remembrance is my certain
Refuge in Calamity.</p>
               <p>I am Impregnated with Sacred Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thy Vertue; I burn
with fervent, paſſionate Deſires to become thy <hi>Diſciple.</hi> I
languiſh to withdraw my ſelf from this vain World; and from the Contagious
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Mortals. How Happy is the Life that's led in quiet Solitude? Where
the <hi>Soul</hi> can feel her ſelf, and being awaken'd to a Senſe of her
Immortal Strength, rouzes and vigorouſly ſhakes off the heavy Clogs of
Sleep and Death: Whilſt the Divine <hi>Afflatus</hi> gently breathing on the
Intellect, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the oppreſſed Sparks of Reaſon, which lay
ſmothering under a Heap of Errours, Luſts, Affections, and unlimited
Deſires; kindles the Mind into a perfect Flame of Light, which ſoon
conſumes the Rubbiſh of Bodily Pleaſures, diſſipates the Smoak and
Miſts of Pamper'd Fleſh and Blood, and then a Man becomes all Radiant
within, ſhining with Unclouded Splendors.</p>
               <p>We Mortals ſeem to be rank'd in a <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle State</hi>
between the <hi>Separate Spirits</hi> and <hi>Beaſts:</hi> Our
<hi>Vertues</hi> make us like the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi> our <hi>Vices,</hi> like
the <hi>Latter.</hi> For, when a Man has quite ſubdu'd his Appetites, and
Reaſon ſits Triumphant in her Throne, he's like an <hi>Angel,</hi> living
above the Rate of his Mortality. He does not with the <hi>Stagyrite</hi> place
<hi>Vertue</hi> in a <hi>Medium,</hi> or rank the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi>

Heroick Generoſity; ſcorning to halt or make lame mungrel Capitulations
with himſelf, as if he were afraid of being too Good.</p>
               <p>I wou'd ask a <hi>Peripatetick,</hi> Whether it be a

Villanies of Wicked Men, boyls up with an Exceſſive Vehement Anger? Or,
Whether a Man, can err in loving <hi>God</hi> too much, or in conceiving too

Favours of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> No: the farther Diſtance Vertue keeps from this
Cold, Earthly <hi>Mediocrity,</hi> the brighter is its Splendor. And ſo on
the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Side, the Greater is the Barbariſm, Brutality and Infernal Stamp
of <hi>Vice,</hi> by how much more Remote it is from this
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference.</hi> In a Word, <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> are Two
Contrary <hi>Extremes:</hi> So <hi>Piety</hi> is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to
<hi>Prophaneneſs: Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> to <hi>Sobriety: Fortitude</hi> to

<hi>Bounty: Modeſty</hi> to <hi>Impudence: Pride</hi> to <hi>Humility:
Enmity</hi> to <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Mediums</hi> between theſe <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes,</hi> are
<hi>Hypocriſy,</hi> between <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice: Superſtition</hi>
between <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs: Baſhfulneſs</hi> between
<hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Impudence,</hi> and ſo of the Reſt.</p>
               <p>Yet, after all, 'tis Neceſſary to obſerve a
<hi>Medium</hi> in thoſe Things which pertain to <pb n="126" facs="tcp:102964:76"/>Mortal
Life, and to the Perpetuation of Mankind: Such are Meats, Drinks, Natural
Paſſions of the Body and Mind, proceeding from the alternate Senſe of
Pleaſure and Pain. So when we are preſs'd with Hunger and Thirſt, we
ought not preſently to covet the Plentiful Tables and Superfluous Banquets of
the <hi>Great;</hi> But rather ſuch a Diet as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſily prepar'd, may
ſatisfie the Cravings of our <hi>Nature,</hi> without nauſeating and
gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us a Surfeit. To this End the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> has
ſcatter'd up and down the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of this Globe, an Infinite Variety of
Roots, Herbs, Fruits, Seeds, with all Sorts of Corn and Pulſe: The Cattle
afford us Plenty of Milk; the Bees are no Niggards of their Honey: the
Fountains, Rivers, and Lakes, abound with ever-ſpringing freſh Supplies of
ſweet refreſhing Water. We alſo have the Uſe of Salt, Oyl, Wine and
other exhilarating Beverages; That being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with ſo many Benefits, and
Enjoyments, we might prolong our Lives in this World by Sobriety, as in a
moſt pleaſant Garden or <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of Health.</p>
               <p>But alas, inſtead of gratefully acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bounty of
<hi>Heaven,</hi> and pregnant Fertility of the <hi>Earth;</hi> Inſtead of
ſitting mannerly down at the <hi>Table</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has ſpread
and cover'd for us, with ſuch a Train of Feſtival Dainties; we break the
Rules of Hoſpitality; and ruſhing violently on the Creatures under his
Protection, we kill and ſlay at Pleaſure, turning the Banquet to a 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102964:76"/>Cruel Maſſacre: being transform'd into a Temper wholly
Brutal and Voracious, we glut our ſelves with Fleſh and Blood of
Slaughter'd <hi>Animals.</hi> Oh! happy he that can content himſelf with
Herbs and other Genuine Products of the Earth; That ſleeps as well in a
Solitary Cave, upon a Bed of Moſs or Leaves, as in a Palace on a Couch of
Down. He never wants, becauſe he ne'er deſires what is not in his Power. He
is not burden'd with a Crowd of Servants and Flattering Retainers; nor his
Repoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd with early and late Addreſſes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Friends,
Officious Sycophants, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Petitioners, and other fretting Buſineſs
of the World.</p>
               <p>Why ſhou'd I longer then demurr or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate; what hinders
me from preſently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing a Courſe of Life, that promiſes ſo much
Happineſs? A Diſcipline that will at once free me from a Thouſand
Tyrannies of Imperious Luſts and Hoſtile Paſſions? I ſhall then have
no Need of Money, or the Help of croſs-grain'd Servants. I ſhall not want a
Multitude of Goods, the Needleſs Pageantry of ſuperfluous Ornaments, to
make a dazling Figure, and draw the Eyes of People to a Reverend Admiration. I
ſhall be free from Sottiſh Drowſineſs, and turbulent Dreams. My Lungs
will in my Sleep reſpire the Air with Eaſe: whilſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Slumbers,
mix'd with happy Viſions, ſhall tranſportt my <hi>Soul</hi> to Unknown
Worlds. No Fevers, Gouts or Dyſente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <pb n="128" facs="tcp:102964:77"/>ſhall invade
my Health: Nor magiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Menaces of <hi>Empericks</hi> beſpeak my
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Death; unleſs I'll patiently ſubmit to all the needleſs Tortures
they're contriving for me, and tamely ſwallow down their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>invented
Poiſons, and be rack'd to Death in Hopes of Eaſe and Life. From all which
horrid Circumſtances, a ſlender, innocent Diet, not ſtain'd with Blood of
any Animal, will ſet me free.</p>
               <p>Holy <hi>Eremite,</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> I have of this Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Life makes a profound and durable Impreſſion on my <hi>Soul.</hi> I am
raviſh'd with the Sentiments of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and
reſolutely bent to undergoe the Diſcipline of their <hi>Philoſophy.</hi>
I'll firſt endeavour to rid my ſelf of vain Affections, Habits, and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Negotiations of the Earth: I'll gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually die to all Concupiſcence
and Bodily Pleaſure; that ſo I may by Equal Steps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive to the
Contemplation of <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Things. Then being free from every Spot
and Stain contracted in the Days of my Security and Careleſneſs; my
Thoughts and Works will be Acceptable to <hi>God:</hi> Who in Return, will
certainly infuſe into my defecate Mind, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Virtue, the Magick of this
Viſible World; which purifying my <hi>Soul</hi> yet farther, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it
for the laſt and higheſt Gift of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bounty to our Race whilſt
in this Life: To wit, a Power of doing <hi>Supernatural</hi> Things, and of
Foretelling Events to come.</p>
               <p>Do thou but pray it may be ſo, and all the Powers of

               <p>IN this Time of <hi>Wars</hi> with <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> when the

               <p>I choſe to addreſs my Letter to thee in Compliance with thy
former Orders, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou ſeemedſt paſſionately deſirous to know
the Preſent State of <hi>Chriſtendom. God</hi> give thee a perpetual
Serenity; <hi>Scribe</hi> of the <hi>Scribes:</hi> May'ſt thou never be
troubled with a Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Eye, a ſhaking Hand, or the Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach. As for me,
I'm a perfect Magazine of Diſeaſes; a walking Hoſpital; The School of
<hi>Aeſculapius.</hi> Where the Neceſſary <hi>God</hi> has Scope to vent
his Skill on all the various kinds of Maladies, which afflict our mortal Race:
Gouts, Fevers, Cramps, and Horrid Dyſenteries, are as Common with me as my
daily Diet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:102964:78"/>However, amidſt all theſe Afflictions,
I ſerve the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> and my Friends with a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Alacrity;
Never grudging to Sacrifice my Eaſe and Health to the Intereſt of <hi>True
Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Face of <hi>Europe</hi> is much chang'd ſince the Decline
of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and the Uſurpations of the <hi>Popes.</hi> That
once Mighty <hi>Monarchy,</hi> is now ſhrunk into a very narrow Compaſs,
being ſhut up within the Confines of <hi>Germany,</hi> which formerly was but
a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Empire.</hi> All <hi>Italy</hi> is
revolted. So are the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States</hi> of
the <hi>Low Countries.</hi> The <hi>Hans-Towns</hi> which in Times paſt paid
Homage to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> have now ſhaken off the Yoke, and are become
Independent <hi>Commonwealths. Tranſylvania</hi> plays faſt and looſe
with him, according as their Intereſt requires. <hi>Livonia</hi> laughs at
his Menaces, as appears by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer they ſent to <hi>Charles</hi> V.
when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Submiſſions, and that they wou'd return to their
Native Allegiance, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe threatning them with Fire and Sword. For, all
the Reply they made, was, That they knew the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s Horſe wou'd
be founder'd, before he cou'd reach the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of their Country.</p>
               <p>'Tis a General Obſervation, that ſince the <hi>Reign</hi> of
<hi>Rodolph</hi> I. above Two Hundred <hi>Principalities</hi> and
<hi>States</hi> have fall'n off from the <hi>Empire.</hi> And thoſe that yet
continue in their Obedience, I mean, the <hi>Electoral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> claim
ſo many Privileges; ſtand ſo much <pb n="131" facs="tcp:102964:78"/>upon
<hi>Punctilio's</hi> and Prerogatives, that there remains now little more of
the <hi>Imperial</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Power, ſave the bare Title and Outward
Pomp. It is Remarkable, That within theſe Three Hundred Years, no leſs than
Nine <hi>German Emperours</hi> have been Murder'd, and many more have been
depos'd and baniſh'd. To ſum up all in a few Words, If we ſurvey the
preſent State of the <hi>German Empire</hi> accurately, if we pry nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into its true circumſtances, we ſhall find, that after all the Clatter of
his Noiſy Titles, the <hi>Emperour</hi> can call nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly his own,
but his <hi>Hereditary Eſtate</hi> in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which is hardly
equivalent to the Territories of ſome <hi>Lords</hi> whom he calls his
<hi>Vaſſals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> in general are a Rude Unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd People,
greedy of Novelties; Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, Raſh, Perfidious, and very Phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick;
much addicted to unnatural Luſts and Inceſtuous Copulations. It is recorded
of <hi>Barbara,</hi> the <hi>Empreſs,</hi> Wife to <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi>
another <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> that after her Husbands Death, her
<hi>Confeſſor</hi> adviſing her to reform her Manners, and live more
chaſtly like the <hi>Turtle,</hi> ſhe anſwer'd, <hi>If I must imitate the
Life of Birds, why not of a Sparrow, as well as a Turtle?</hi> Her Brother
<hi>Frederick</hi> was much ſuch another: For at Ninety Years of Age, he
murder'd his Wife for the Sake of a Strumpet: And being adviſed to repent and
think of his Grave; He ſaid, <hi>I am now ſtudying my Epitaph, which I
deſign ſhall be compriz'd in theſe Words:</hi> 
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:102964:79"/> 
                  <q>This is my Way to <hi>Hell;</hi> I know not what I ſhall
find there: What I have left behind me I know. I abounded in all Delights,
whereof I carry nothing with me: Neither my dainty Meats or pleaſant Wines,
or whatſoever my Inſatiable Luxury exhauſted.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Drunkenneſs</hi> is ſaid to be the Original Sin of
<hi>Germany,</hi> from whence it ſpread it ſelf into other Countries. They
give this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>German,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"That he is an Animal which drinks more than he
can carry: A Tun that contains more than he can vent: And that he underſtands
more than he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs."</q> They tell a Story of Four Old
<hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> who at one Sitting, drank as many Healths as they could make
up Years amongſt them, which amounted to Three Hundred. And 'tis Recorded of
a certain <hi>German Count,</hi> That he us'd to make his Children, whilſt
yet Infants, drink luſtily, to prove whether they were of his own begetting
or no: For, if they grew Sick after it, he preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them to be
Baſtards: But if they cou'd bear the Debauch well, he cheriſh'd 'em as his
own True Off-ſpring. In a Word, thou mayſt have the ſame <hi>Idea</hi> of
the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> at this Day, as <hi>Solyman</hi> the <hi>Magnificent</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:102964:79"/>had in his Time, who us'd to ſay, 
<q rend="inline">"I ſlight the <hi>Germans</hi> above all other
People of <hi>Europe,</hi> becauſe they are always at diſcord among
themſelves, nor can they ever be united any more than my Fingers and Toes.
They cannot endure Labour; and are the Exceſſiv'ſt Gluttons and Drunkards
in the World; They always maintain a Regiment of Whores in their Camp. Their
<hi>Generals</hi> take more Pride in their <hi>Feathers,</hi> than in their
<hi>Military Arms.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>In a Word, the <hi>German</hi> is ſo over-run with all Kinds
of Vice, that he wants nothing to make him a Complete <hi>Devil,</hi> but only
a little Tincture of the <hi>Italian</hi> Qualities, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Proverb,
<hi>Tudeſco Italianato, e un Diabolo Incarnato; A German Italianiz'd, is a
Devil Incarnate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis certain, the <hi>French</hi> have ſo weaken'd 'em on one
Hand, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that conſidering the frequent
Troubles they meet with from the <hi>Hungarians, Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians,</hi> and other
Tributary Nations, beſides the Inteſtine Feuds of the <hi>Electoral
Princes;</hi> we need not fear the blunted <hi>Talons</hi> of the

State, or prop her from falling into Ruine: So far is ſhe from being able to
offend her Neighbours, that ſhe never makes War her Choice, or takes the
Field but by Compulſion, in her own Defence.</p>
               <p>Illuſtrious <hi>Hamet,</hi> I pray <hi>God</hi> inſpire the
Victorious <hi>Oſmans</hi> with Prophetick Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Reſolution; and the

               <p>THE Friendſhip that has been contracted between thee and me,

which infects chiefly the moſt Effeminate Part of Mankind. Such as are
theſe <hi>Weſtern Nazarenes;</hi> who abound in a Thouſand little
Complaiſances, and falſe Civilities; thus ſuffering their own Integrity
to be corrupted; their Vertue and Faſtneſs of Spirit, to be ſurpriz'd and
debauch'd; whilſt their Friends, by theſe means, not ſeldom run on
Precipices, and fall into Inevitable Ruine. In a Word, they betray one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:102964:80"/>By what I have ſaid, thou wilt
comprehend, That I do not reprove thee out of Spight, Envy, Malice or an

endeavouring to ſet the <hi>Emperour's</hi> Palace on Fire: Or to poiſon

               <p>Tho' thou art ſeemingly engag'd in the Cauſe of the

               <p>'Tis this puts them upon Caballing and entring into

Mournful <hi>Rites</hi> of her <hi>Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Commenc'd: She made but one
Remove from her <hi>Marriage</hi>-Bed, to the <hi>Grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou wondereſt, that a Woman of her Age, being Seventy Five
Years Old; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already had Two Husbands, ſhould marry a Third; Know,
that it was not Dotage, but Diſcretion which prompted her to take this
Courſe. The Integrity, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and prudent Conduct of <hi>Eliachim</hi>
the <hi>Jew,</hi> had charm'd her Affections long ago, and improv'd her
Acquaintance with him, into a ſtrict and vertuous Friendſhip. As a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhe ow'd him Reſpect and Love, for his conſtant Fidelity to me: And on
her own Account, ſhe cou'd not but entertain Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Eſteem and
Gratitude for a Man, who had been ſo nicely careful to preſerve her 
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102964:82"/>Perſon and Honour from Injury and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ever
ſince ſhe came to <hi>Paris.</hi> For, he alone, among the many Myriads of
People inhabiting this <hi>City,</hi> was the onely Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both of her
Secrets and mine. In a Word, theſe Regards, with ſome others of Piety,
Zeal, and Good Nature, made her willing to become his Wife, who in all Things
had perform'd the Part of a Friend, and a Perſon of Honour.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, it was really her Intereſt, thus to
diſpoſe of her later Days in a <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Country,</hi> where ſhe knew
no body but <hi>Eliachim</hi> and me. As for me, ſhe conſider'd that my
Life was not onely ſubject to the ſame Caſualties with other Mortals, and
that I might be ſnatch'd away by a Thouſand Deaths; but that my
<hi>Station</hi> here was very Precarious, and I might be ſuddenly recall'd
by my <hi>Superiours</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or at leaſt be
remov'd to ſome other <hi>Poſt,</hi> whither ſhe cou'd not accompany me,
being Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bearing, at theſe Years, the Hardſhips and Fatigues of
Travel: That after my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, ſhe ſhou'd be neglected, contemn'd, and
abandon'd by all, but thoſe who wou'd deſire her Death, for the Sake of her
Money and Jewels.</p>
               <p>In theſe Circumſtances, to remain a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, profeſſing
the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and believing the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> in
a <hi>Region</hi> and <hi>City</hi> ſwarming with <hi>Infidels;</hi> wou'd
have been but an uncomfortable as well as a dangerous Condition. Wherefore
having had Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <pb n="140" facs="tcp:102964:83"/>of <hi>Eliachim</hi>'s Vertue, and
incorrupt Manners, he alſo making Addreſſes of Love to her, and giving
her Encouragement to hope, that he wou'd become a <hi>Muſſulman;</hi> ſhe
yielded at laſt to the Thoughts of taking him for her Husband, and they were
mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the 7th. of this <hi>Moon,</hi> in a private <hi>Synagogue</hi> of
the <hi>Jews:</hi> For, they are not allow'd a <hi>Publick</hi> One in this
<hi>City,</hi> as they are in many other <hi>Cities</hi> of
<hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Mother appear'd neither too deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly ſad, nor
profuſely merry, during the <hi>Nuptial Feaſt.</hi> But comporting her
ſelf with a chearful Reſervedneſs, ſeem'd to have her Thoughts rather
fix'd on ſomething elſe, than the vain Ceremonies, Noiſe, and Mirth of
the Company. It looks as if her Prophetick Soul was ſenſible of its
approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Releaſe: For, to be Brief, ſhe was found Dead in her Bed next
Morning.</p>
               <p>Brother, ſhe is now in her <hi>Sepulchre,</hi> at Reſt from
all the Toils of Humane Life. Let not this News affect thee with fruitleſs
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; ſince Death is the Common Fate of all Mortals. Rather advance
the Bliſs of our deceas'd Parent, with devout <hi>Oraiſons</hi> for her
Soul; Remembring, that e'er long, we ſhall be in the ſame Condition. For
tho' Man, like a Moth, be paſſionately enamour'd with the Light of this
World; tho' he flutter and dance about it for a while, basking in the Splendor
and Warmth of his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; yet at length he is conſum'd by the very
Flame, which gave him Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, <pb n="141" facs="tcp:102964:83"/>and falls a

I will unlock the Treaſures <pb n="142" facs="tcp:102964:84"/>of the Country, without

Reſolution and Valour of Military Men, than the Hopes of Plunder, and
paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away a Campaign in Plenty of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Comforts. I will
give thee a true Account of the Natural Dowry of theſe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> the
Riches of the Soil, and the Wealth, which Commerce with other Nations,
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Spoils of former Wars, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the People, and
the Benevolence of Fortune have added to their Store.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Germany</hi> abounds in Generous Wines, and thoſe more
laſting than any other in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Rheniſh Wines will keep
above Fifty Years. The Wines of the <hi>Neckar</hi> are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and clear
as Water from the Rock: Thoſe of <hi>Franconia</hi> are ſtrong and
operative: The <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Grape is ſweet and luſcious. Several
<hi>Roman Emperours</hi> have preferr'd the Fruits of the <hi>German</hi>
Vintage, to thoſe of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Greece.</hi> And ſuch is the
ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Plenty of Vineyards, that at a Place call'd <hi>Stutgard,</hi>
there is a <hi>Proverb</hi> currant, <hi>That they have more Wine than
Water.</hi> If our <hi>Janizaries</hi> knew this, they wou'd be for an
Expedition into <hi>Germany.</hi> Nay they tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per their Mortar with Wine in
ſome Places, and ſlack their Lime with it.</p>
               <p>They have ſtrong Beverages alſo made of Barley, Wheat, and
other Grain, which they tranſport from <hi>Brumſwick, Breſlaw, Delph,
Dantzick, Lubeck,</hi> and other Places, to moſt Countries in the

                  <hi>Europe.</hi>
They likewiſe make a Sort of Wine of Honey, as ſtrong and Sweet as the Wine
of <hi>Candy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is abundance of Frankincenſe and Myrrh in
<hi>Moravia,</hi> of Saffron in <hi>Auſtria,</hi> of <hi>Licorice</hi> in
<hi>Franconia,</hi> of <hi>Madder</hi> for Dyers in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> of
Amber in <hi>Thuringia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Innumerable Orchards full of all delectable Fruits,
the Fields ſtand thick with Corn, the Paſtures are throng'd with Cattel,
and they have a Breed of the ſtouteſt Horſes in the World. They have
Timber enough to ſerve all the Nations in the World for Shipping. But that
which is moſt inviting is, the Variety of Mines of Gold, Silver, Copper,
Lead, Tin and Iron. Before <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> was diſcover'd, <hi>Germany</hi>
was the <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Potoſi</hi> of all <hi>Europe.</hi> They have
alſo Plenty of Marble as bright as Cryſtal.</p>
               <p>Beſides their Native and Domeſtick Riches, they have
mightily improv'd their Stock, by Foreign Commerce; exchanging their
Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities for things more precious and of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Value: Which in a
conſtant Courſe of Bartering, brings into the <hi>German</hi> Coffers ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Hundred Millions of Crowns in a Year. In a Word, their Cities are ſo Rich,
that when they have been pillag'd by an Enemy, the booty of one City, has been
valu'd at Two Millions of Crowns, in ready Money, beſides Plate and Jewels.
The Common Souldiers have made Hilts for their Swords and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Gold and
Silver; nay, ſome would have their very Helmets of the ſame Metals. 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102964:85"/>Publick Gaming Tables have been ſet up in the Streets,
and it has been Common for a private Trooper to win or loſe Five or Ten
Thouſand Crowns at a Time. This would be rare Sport for our

Rigid, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Sort of <hi>Muſſulman Phanaticks,</hi> who bear an
endleſs Grudge againſt all thoſe that are not of their Narrow Faith, and
Dark Opinion.</p>
               <p>Glory be to <hi>God,</hi> with whom the WORD was preſent from
the <hi>Dawning</hi> of <hi>Eternal Light,</hi> before the <hi>Morning</hi> of

<hi>Halo</hi> in, and ſpong'd up all the Viſible Beams to ſqueeze them
out again upon the <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Stars,</hi> and on this Lower World.
That WORD remains for Ever, and at a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd Hour became Incarnate, in the
Perſon of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> as the <hi>Holy
Alcoran</hi> informs us.</p>
               <p>In thoſe Days <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> went into

about him with a Belt made of that Painful and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Creatures Skin, to
put him in Mind, that he was born for <hi>Holy</hi> Labours, Toils, and
Mortifications. He had no Table ſpread with far-fetch'd coſtly Dainties; no
Diſhes cramm'd with bloody and large Inventories of Birds, Four-footed
Beaſts, and Fiſh. His Diet was Simple, Cheap, and Innocent; eaſie to be
got in every Wood or Field, without the Detriment of his Fellow-Animals. For he
either contented himſelf with a Repaſt on Honey, which he found in Hollow
Trees; or on a Kind of <hi>Manna,</hi> a ſweet <hi>Dew</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on their
Leaves, and there condens'd by Heavenly Influence: Or elſe it was a kind of

Occaſion to allay his Hunger with theſe little Shell-fiſh, which he might
eaſily take in mighty Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from their watry Neſts. And they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſtrengthen this Opinion, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, That the Food which the Waters
afford us, is much more Pure and Holy than what the Earth brings forth; in
regard the Earth lies under the Malediction of <hi>God,</hi> ever ſince
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, whereas the <hi>Waters</hi> ne'er were Curs'd. Hence,
ſay they, it is very probable. That the conſecrated <hi>Hero,</hi> wou'd
not defile his Spotleſs Life with curſed Banquets from the Earth, but
rather choſe to appeaſe his Hunger with the harmleſs, bleſs'd, and
wholſome Product of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>If thou wilt have my Opinion after all, I'm apt to think theſe

and pleaſant to an Abſtemious Man, than to ſuſtain his Life with
fruits, Grain, Herbs, or Roots? Nor did the Malediction reach the
<hi>Vegetables,</hi> but only the <hi>Animal</hi> Generations, from which a
perfect Man abſtains.</p>
               <p>Certainly, thoſe, who out of an Averſion for Purity, Prayer,
and Faſting, turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Humane Bodies to Swine; and from
Religious Abſtinence to Salvage Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundizing on Fleſh, ſeem to derive
their Pedigree from a Race of <hi>Devils:</hi> Eſpecially ſuch as after the
manner of <hi>Spiders,</hi> gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Poiſon from the Flowers of Piety,
Blaſpheme this Sacred Vertue of Abſtinence, and call it by the Infamous
Name of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
               <p>For, if the Veneration we pay to <hi>God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in
the Knowledge, Love and Fear of his <hi>Divine</hi> Majeſty, with Adoration
and Praiſe of his Eternal Attributes; it follows, That we ought to worſhip
him with the moſt Fervent Application of our Spirits. But this
<hi>Religious</hi> Ardour cannot ſubſiſt in any <hi>Soul,</hi> whoſe
Body is not mortified; nor can the Body be mortified without Auſterity, which
always is accompany'd with Rigorous Faſting and Abſtinence from Fleſh.
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we aſcend to <hi>God,</hi> by the very ſame 
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102964:88"/>Degrees as we fall from him, it follows, That Abſtinence
is the Firſt Step to Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and Supreme Happineſs.</p>
               <p>I do not mean by Abſtinence, that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Averſion which
ſome Men have for Fleſh, who never durſt to taſte of any in their
Lives, compell'd to this by ſome Occult <hi>Antipathy</hi> in their Stomachs.
For ſuch a Neceſſity cannot make a Vertue, it being common to Men and
Brutes; there being many <hi>Animals,</hi> who faſt from all Provender at
certain Seaſons of the Year, and others that taſte not ſome Kinds of
Food, during their Lives. So there are ſome Men, to whom Wine, Fleſh,
Cheeſe, Apples, Herbs and other Things, are an Abomination from their
Cradles. There have been others, who, by a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural Neceſſity, have
lived ſome Days, VVeeks, Months and Years without either Meat or Drink. So
<hi>Plato</hi> records, That <hi>Herus Pamphylius</hi> lay Ten whole Days among
the Dead Carcaſes of Soldiers ſlain in Battel; and, when he was taken up to
be laid on the Funeral Pile, they perceiv'd him to be alive. <hi>Laertius</hi>
tells us, That <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> faſted Forty Days and Forty Nights from
Meat and Drink. From whom <hi>Apollonius Thyanaeus</hi> learn'd the Art of
keeping almoſt a perpetual Faſt. And theſe Modern Times afford us the
Example of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whom they call <hi>Alcantaro,</hi> who every
<hi>Moon</hi> us'd to Faſt for Seven or Eight Days together. So a famous
<hi>German Maid</hi> was diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and watch'd, whilſt ſhe
paſs'd away <pb n="151" facs="tcp:102964:88"/>full Seven Years Time without Meat, Drink,
Sleep or Excrements. <hi>France</hi> alſo boaſts of another
<hi>Virgin,</hi> who faſted above Three Years together.</p>
               <p>Such Abſtinences as theſe, are not to be put to the Account
of Vertue, in regard they were not the Effects of Humane Choice, but the
<hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Fate.</hi> So wou'd our Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence be deprav'd, if
we ſhou'd only pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it, as the old <hi>Gentiles</hi> did, who forbore
to kill or eat ſome certain Beaſts, becauſe they held them conſecrated
to their <hi>Gods.</hi> As the <hi>Dog</hi> to <hi>Diana;</hi> the
<hi>Tyger</hi> to <hi>Bacchus;</hi> the <hi>Horſe</hi> to <hi>Neptune;</hi>
the <hi>Woolf</hi> to <hi>Mars;</hi> the <hi>Eagle</hi> to <hi>Jupiter;</hi>
the <hi>Peacock</hi> to <hi>Juno;</hi> the <hi>Swan</hi> to <hi>Apollo;</hi>
the <hi>Dove</hi> to <hi>Venus;</hi> the <hi>Owl</hi> to <hi>Minerva.</hi> Nor
need we abſtain on the Account of the <hi>Soul</hi>'s Tranſmigration; for,
ſo we ought to forbear the <hi>Vegetable</hi> Products of the Earth, as well
as <hi>Animals,</hi> ſince the <hi>Soul</hi> is Indifferent to all Bodies, in
its ſeparate State.</p>
               <p>But our Reaſon in this Point, ought to take its Riſe from
the <hi>Fundamental Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Original
Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which teaches us, <hi>Not to do that to
another, which we wou'd not have another do to us.</hi> Now, ſince 'tis
evident, That no Man wou'd willingly become the Food of Beaſts; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by the ſame Rule, he ought not to prey on them. Next to this Foundation of
our Abſtinence, we ought to build our Aims at the Perfection of our Nature,
which cannot be acquir'd but by Degrees: We muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102964:89"/>to abate the Aliment of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences, by exhaling
the ſuperfluous and groſſer Vapours of our Blood in Sacred Faſts and
Oraiſons. Then we ſhou'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our fainting Bodies, with Food
affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding little Nouriſhment and Pleaſure. That ſo our vain Affections,
Appetites and Luſts, may gradually die: Whilſt the pure Mind revives, and
being free from the groſs Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours ariſing from too much, and too fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Meats and Drinks, the Films which darken'd her Sight, fall off; and ſhe can
better now diſcern the Naked Forms of Things, by her own ſimple Intuition,
than before ſhe cou'd through all the borrow'd Spectacles and other
<hi>Opticks</hi> of <hi>Book-Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi> Alſo ſhe will more
eaſily raiſe her ſelf to the Contemplation and Science of Divine Eternal
Things. He therefore that in Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt will apply himſelf to the Study of
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Sanctity, muſt firſt by Faſting exhauſt the Marrow from
his Bones, the Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from his Fleſh, the Wild and Rampant Spirits from
his Nerves, and then he muſt purge the Words and Actions of his Life from
Vice. When this is done, the <hi>Soul</hi> becoming a pure <hi>Tabula
Raſa,</hi> is fit for the Impreſſions of Celeſtial Vertue.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who labour under acute Diſeaſes, run great Hazard of
their Lives, according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> unleſs their Diet be
accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with proportionate Regard to the Quality and Time of the Critical
Fits or Paroxiſms. But, thoſe who are entangl'd <pb n="153" facs="tcp:102964:89"/>with
Vice, do labour under far more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Diſtempers, than ſuch as afflict
the Body. Wherefore the Prophet, our Holy Law-giver, like a Wiſe Phyſician,
appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted certain Seaſons of the Year, for Sacred Abſtinences, Faſtings,
Pilgrimages, Vigils, and other Holy Exerciſes, eſpecially the Mighty Faſt
and Vigil of <hi>Ramezan,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, tho' it be not forbid to eat of
Fleſh after the Stars appear at Night, yet none but looſe and indevout
Believers, take that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; whereas the better Sort content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with an Aſcetick Diet. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> faſted with Unleaven'd Bread,
and a little Salad; the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> alſo taſte no Fleſh, on
their prohibited Days: And ſhall the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> be greater
<hi>Libertines</hi> than theſe <hi>Infidels?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O <hi>Hebatolla!</hi> how radiant is the Luſtre of a Lamp,
when ſhining through a clean, and fine, defaecate Chryſtal? So does the
Soul diſplay the Rays of her Immortal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue round about, when ſhe
inhabits in a well purifi'd, chaſte, and almoſt pervious Body. VVherefore,
it is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for him to attenuate his Body with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Temperance and Abſtinence, who conſecrates himſelf to Vertue and
Devotion. He will not be enſnar'd or catch'd by any Baits of Luxury or
Voluptuouſneſs; not yet affrighted from his conſtant, ſober Courſe of
Life, by any Pain, or thwarting Accident. No Frowns or Menaces ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him from his Noble Purpoſe: But he <pb n="154" facs="tcp:102964:90"/>will ſo nouriſh
his Body all his Life, that it ſhall never be Surfeited, or over-fill'd with
Meats. And ſuch is the Magick of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Vertue, That it can never be
hurt, much leſs ſubverted by all the Machinations of Evil <hi>Daemons;</hi>
or the Malicious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of Men. But it proceeds from Strength to Strength,
and fights the Combat valiantly, till having overcome at laſt, it Triumphs
for ever, and receives the Palm, the Crown and Chaplet of Divine Reward in
<hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Holy Preſident, pray that I may practiſe what I ſo admire,
and not be ſelf-condemn'd for living contrary to my Knowledge. For
<hi>God</hi> neither loves a double Tongue or Heart, neither delights he in
Feet or Hands that are ſwift and nimble to do Miſchief.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There is great Joy in <hi>Portugal</hi> for the Birth of the

Daughter. Theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Queens are very pregnant. Not a Year
paſſes without the Birth, or Baptiſm, of ſome <hi>Royal</hi>
Infant.</p>
               <p>This is all the News at preſent; but to oblige thee I will
ſay ſomething of <hi>Italy,</hi> which is eſteem'd the Garden of
<hi>Europe.</hi> Nay, <hi>Conſtantine Paleologus, Emperor</hi> of
<hi>Greece,</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs I had been aſſur'd by
very Learned and Holy Men, that Paradiſe was ſeated in</hi> Aſia, <hi>I
ſhou'd have ſworn that</hi> Italy <hi>had been the Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is moſt certain <hi>Italy</hi> is a delectable Country,
abounding in Riches and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The Eye is not ſatisfi'd with ſeeing
the infinite Variety of Beauties, which grace this happy Region. Such is the
lovely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixture of Hills and Valleys, Groves and Plains, Palaces and
Gardens, that a Traveller is raviſh'd as he paſſes on the Road. But this
is not all: She is as rich as fair. No Country in the World can match
<hi>Italy</hi> for the Plenty and Variety of excellent Wines; only they are of
no long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Above all the reſt, Travellers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that Sort which
they call <hi>Lachrymae Chriſti,</hi> or, the <hi>Tears of Chriſt,</hi> for
its deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Taſte. Which when a <hi>Dutch-man</hi> once taſted, he
burſt forth into this Excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; <hi>O Chriſt! why didſt thou not weep
in my Country?</hi> At <hi>Papia,</hi> there are a Kind of Aromatick Grapes,
which leave a fragrant Odour in the Mouth of him that eats them. 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102964:91"/>It is recorded of a certain <hi>Roman Lord,</hi> That when
he was in Priſon half dead with Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, he drank a Glaſs or Two of
this generous Wine, which ſo reviv'd his Spirits, that inſtead of
Deſpairing, as he was ready to do before, he wrote a <hi>Treatiſe</hi>
entituled <hi>[de Conſolatione.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>Italy</hi> abounds in Cattle, Sheep, Fowls,
Mines, Rocks of Alabaſter, Marble, Porphyry, Coral, Ophits, Agats,
Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donies, Azures, and innumerable other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones. Hence it comes,
that in this Country are ſeen the moſt Glorious and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
<hi>Temples</hi> of the World.</p>
               <p>But, this ſo fair and wealthy a Spot of Ground is Inhabited by
a very wicked Sort of People. They are quite degenerated from the Vertues of
their <hi>Anceſtors.</hi> They are a Baſe, Effeminate, Sly,
<hi>Sodomitical</hi> Race of Men, Covetous, Revengeful, and Inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I have
heard a Story of Two <hi>Italian</hi> Brothers that were walking one Night in
the Fields, it being a very ſerene Sky; when one of them looking
ſteadfaſtly on the <hi>Heavens,</hi> wiſh'd, <hi>he had as many Oxen as
there were Stars.</hi> The other wiſh'd, <hi>he had a Field as large as the
Firmament. What wou'd you do with it?</hi> ſaid the Firſt. <hi>Let your
Oxen graze there,</hi> reply'd he. But, as they proceeded in this Kind of
fooliſh, looſe Diſcourſe, they kindled each others Anger; and at
length, falling from. Words to Blows, kill'd one another on the Spot. Behold,
the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their Covetous Deſires. They <pb n="158" facs="tcp:102964:92"/>are
extremely addicted to Revenge, and are as dextrous at poyſoning as the
<hi>Indian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. A certain <hi>French Author</hi> gives us a very
Compendious Account of the Benefits a Stranger gets by travelling into
<hi>Italy,</hi> in theſe Words: <hi>We go into</hi> Italy, ſays he,
<hi>with Incredible Charges, only to purchaſe the mere Shadow of Civility,
and we bring back from thence the whole Syſtem of Vices.</hi> The
<hi>Mila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe</hi> teach us how to Cheat. From the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> we
learn Hypocriſie. <hi>Rome</hi> tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us into perfect
<hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Libertines. Naples</hi> turns us to <hi>Satyres.
Florence</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs us in the Artificial Methods of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. There
is not one City, which does not tincture us with ſome Specifick Ill

               <p>THou may'ſt Regiſter in the Archives of the Sacred

perpetual <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> under the
<hi>Spaniſh King</hi>'s Obedience. He is alſo <hi>Viceroy,</hi> and
<hi>Vicar-General</hi> of <hi>Arragon, Catalonia,</hi> and <hi>Valenciae.</hi>
But it is fit for thee to know alſo, That this is ſo far from being
eſteem'd by that Prince a Happineſs, that he counts it his Greateſt
Misfortune, in Regard 'tis no better than an Honourable and Irrevocable
Baniſhment from the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> where his
<hi>Royal</hi> Blood and Merits, are out-maſter'd by the <hi>Genius</hi> of a
certain <hi>Prieſt,</hi> whom they call <hi>Father Nitard.</hi> This Man is
very Ambitious, always aiming at High Matters; yet admir'd by no body for his
Learning, Beauty, or any other good Qualities. Only the <hi>Queen</hi> of
<hi>Spain,</hi> is pleas'd to make him her Favourite.</p>
               <p>He cou'd never buckle to the Humour of <hi>Dom John;</hi> and
hence aroſe a ſecret Envy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 'em; which afterwards burſt forth
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open Animoſities, Feuds and Quarrels. So that at laſt, the Favourite
got the Day, and <hi>Dom John</hi> was forc'd to quit the Field.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible to trace the <hi>Sovereigns</hi> of the

it. He knew, that his Heroick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter took Delight in any Thing was bold and
brave. But how to come into his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he was Ignorant. At length, he
pitch'd upon this Method. One Day, as <hi>Alexander</hi> was debauching with
his beloved <hi>Parmenio, Haepheſton, Lyſimachus,</hi> and other Officers.
This Fellow (whoſe Name was <hi>Clytus</hi>) put himſelf into a Mimick
Dreſs of War, counterfeiting himſelf Mad, and dancing the <hi>Pyrrhick</hi>
Meaſures, with his brandiſh'd Sword, kill'd Five new-liſted Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
lately come from <hi>Colchis.</hi> The Guards ſoon ſiez'd upon him; and it
being a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical</hi> Novelty, the News was carried to the <hi>King;</hi>
who caus'd the Fellow to be brought before him. And examining him on the Point,
<hi>Clytus</hi> anſwer'd, 
<q rend="inline">"Great <hi>King,</hi> thoſe Five Men whom I
have kill'd, had conſpir'd to take away thy Life this Day, being hir'd

Opportunity laſt Night, of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearing their Diſcourſe, when they were
plotting together the Time, the Place, and Manner of thy Death. I kept a Watch

<hi>Houſe:</hi> For which they ſolemnly ſung their <hi>Te Deum,</hi> or a
<hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Praiſe</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> And the <hi>Court</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> ſeems to be proud of the Honour this <hi>Prince</hi> has done
it, in retiring hither, and making it the <hi>Theatre</hi> of ſuch Pious
Reſolves, the laſt Stage of his <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> on Earth, where he will
bid <hi>Adieu</hi> to the vain Pageantries of Honour, Wealth and Empire; and
having ſhaken off the Glittering Burden of a <hi>Crown,</hi> with all the
other Clogs of elevated Mortality, he will the eaſier climb to
<hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Abſtracting from the Particular <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions</hi> of
the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> I cannot but commend the Sage Undertaking of <hi>King
Caſimir;</hi> who, in this, ſeem to outgoe the noiſie oſtentous Action
of <hi>Adrian,</hi> one of the <hi>Roman Emperors:</hi> For he only once
cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in outward Pomp his own <hi>Funerals,</hi> by way of <hi>Type</hi>
or <hi>Figure;</hi> making a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Cavalcade, before which his
<hi>Coffin</hi> was <pb n="164" facs="tcp:102964:95"/>carried in a kind of
<hi>Mock-Triumph:</hi> As if after all his other Victories, at laſt he had
lead <hi>Death</hi> himſelf <hi>Captive:</hi> Whereas this hinder'd not, but
that he return'd again to the Vanities which in this Publick <hi>Emblem</hi> he
ſeem'd to deſpiſe; And from a <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Conqueror,</hi> he became a
real Slave. His perſonated Mortification in the Streets, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his
ordinary Paſſions at Home. And he had a ſtronger Inclination to the Bed
of Voluptuouſneſs at Night, than he ſeem'd to have by Day to his
Grave.</p>
               <p>But this Heroick <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Poles,</hi> is really
gone into his <hi>Sepulchre.</hi> (For no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a <hi>Monaſtery</hi> in
my Opinion.) He has tranſlated the <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Throne</hi> of his
<hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to a <hi>Tomb;</hi> not for Three or Four Hours, to make a
ſhew, but there really to lead a dying Life, or living Death; and reign in
<hi>Funeral</hi> Majeſty all the Reſt of his Days. For, to be thus
<hi>Recluſe</hi> from the World, is to be buried alive.</p>
               <p>O Venerable and Benign <hi>Dervich,</hi> pardon the Favourable
Opinion I have of this <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Monarch.</hi> I do not patronize his
Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in applauding his Vertue. Beſides, it is the General <hi>Faith</hi>
of <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> That, let a Man be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> a
<hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> provided he lives up to the beſt Light he
has, he ſhall be ſaved. And the <hi>Holy Prophet</hi> himſelf gave us
Encouragement to believe ſo.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt at leaſt conclude this <hi>King</hi> to be more
Pious and worthy of Praiſe, than <pb n="165" facs="tcp:102964:95"/>one of his
<hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> who uſurp'd the <hi>Poliſh Crown.</hi> This was
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> V. who having enter'd into a ſolemn League with one
of our Former <hi>Sultans,</hi> living in his Time, and taken an Oath
thereupon, giving alſo the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> (or, that which they eſteem
the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) in <hi>Hoſtage;</hi> yet ſoon after
broke the <hi>Articles</hi> that he had Sign'd, Seal'd, and Sworn to, and for
the Performance of which he had pawn'd his <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſo provok'd the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> that he had
recourſe to his Arms for Juſtice, and invaded <hi>Poland</hi> with a Mighty
Force: To repell which, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> alſo levied an Army, and met
him in the Field. But, juſt as they were going to give Battel, the
<hi>Sultan</hi> took out of his Boſom, the paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> with
the <hi>Capitulations</hi> agreed upon, and ſworn to between 'em. Then
holding the <hi>Wafer</hi> in One Hand, and the <hi>Articles</hi> in the Other,
he cryed out, in the Hearing of both Armies; 
<q rend="inline">"O thou <hi>Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd God</hi> of the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> behold thy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Adorers, who have given thee to
me as a Pledge of their Faith and Truth in what they have ſworn; yet in a
moſt Impious Manner they have violated their Oath. If thou art a <hi>God</hi>
chaſtiſe them now by my means, for their Abominable Perjury, and
Prophanation of thy Name."</q> His Prayer was heard of <hi>Heaven:</hi> For the
Victorious <hi>Oſmans</hi> gave a Total Overthrow to the <hi>Infidels;</hi>
and that Blaſphemous <hi>Prince</hi> was himſelf kill'd in the Battel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:102964:96"/>Whatever various <hi>Forms</hi> of
<hi>Religion</hi> there be in the World; we know there is but <hi>One True God,
Creator</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth, Conſervator</hi> and
<hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Men.</hi> He connives at the Invincible Ignorances,
Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Infirmities of our Mortal Race. He accepts the Good Works and
Sincere Vows of <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſed,</hi> as well as
thoſe of the <hi>True Believers,</hi> and <hi>Followers</hi> of the
<hi>Prophet.</hi> But he abhorrs and puniſhes all Injuſtice, Perjury, and
Treaſon, both in the One and the Other. For he has no Partial Regards for
This Nation or Perſon, more than for That. They are all equally the Works of
his Hands; and his Care is alike over them.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Moon</hi> never ſlacks or deviates from her wonted

Knowing that She is but a Second Remove from the <hi>Eternal Light:</hi> The

               </p>

left <hi>Poland,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw Prince <hi>Wieſnowiski</hi>
elected his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. The Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and
<hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> had ſeverally laid Claim to that Crown, and levied Armies
a-part, in order to make good their Pretentions. But the <hi>Polanders,</hi>
being aware of it, were reſolv'd not to bring themſelves under the
Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Foreigner, ſo long as there was a Prince of their own
Nation capable of the Dignity, and one who being the Son of King
<hi>Caſimir,</hi> ſeems to have the beſt Title to his Father's Throne,
whoſe Vertues he inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
               <p>Here is alſo arriv'd the Prince of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> who has
travell'd through all <hi>Europe,</hi> and <pb n="170" facs="tcp:102964:98"/>takes
<hi>France,</hi> as the laſt Kingdom, in his Return Homewards: Proteſting,
That he does this in good Manners, as preferring <hi>France</hi> to all the
Nations in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> Indeed, he cou'd do no leſs in Good
Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, than make this Apology, which yet ſounds very Flat toa Court ſo
refin'd as this; which might have expected his Firſt Viſit as a Token of
his Regard; ſince, tho' in Domeſtick <hi>Proceſſions, Entries,</hi> and

in <hi>Foreign Embaſſies,</hi> and <hi>Voyages,</hi> it is uſual for
Princes to addreſs to thoſe firſt, for whom they have the Greateſt

               <p>The <hi>Politicians</hi> here keep very ſecret the News that
comes from <hi>Candy,</hi> which makes all Men conclude, 'tis none of the
moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous. 'Tis generally reported for a Truth, That Admiral
<hi>Beaufort</hi> is either Kill'd, or taken Priſoner by the
<hi>Ottomans;</hi> and that the <hi>French</hi> have loſt near Two thouſand
Men in this Undertaking.</p>
               <p>I wonder why the Painters always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Death in the Form
of a <hi>Naked Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton,</hi> a Starv'd <hi>Syſtem</hi> of dry Bones:
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one would think, he ought to be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd as a Monſter, a Miracle
of Fatneſs; ſince he is the greateſt Glutton in the World, hourly
gurmundizing on all manner of Fleſh, and is the very Original, Univerſal
<hi>Cannibal</hi> of Nature, who from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World has feaſted
himſelf with <pb n="171" facs="tcp:102964:98"/>Humane Bodies. But, perhaps, he has a bad
Digeſtion, and none of all his raw and bloody Diet, will afford Nutriment
enough to form ſo much as a poor Skin to cover his Nakedneſs. And,
therefore 'tis he's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways drawn in this <hi>lean</hi> Figure.</p>
               <p>Courteous <hi>Baſſa,</hi> ſuffer me from this vain Jeſt,
to fall into a ſerious Reflection on our Mortality, and the frail Eſtate of
Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Race.</p>
               <p>Man's but a fetid Vapour, firſt exhal'd from the Earth, and
afterwards advancing, is condens'd into a Cloud, that ſo his Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs
may be conceal'd under the Covert of a Skin, there in Secret to engender a
Thouſand <hi>Meteors</hi> of <hi>Fiery</hi> Paſſions, Luſts,
Concupiſcences, and Extravagant Thoughts. Which in time burſt forth, and
trouble all the World: Yet end at laſt in empty Smoak, Rain, Hail, or Wind,
and are extinct al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſoon as they were form'd.</p>
               <p>The Elements of which we are compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, may ſerve as
Mirrours to repreſent the conſtant Mutability of our Nature. So the
devouring Fire, when all its Fuel is ſpent, decays and dies. Earth, Air, and
Water, all are ſubject to Corruption, and from thence our Generation takes
its Riſe: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thither we return again. This is the Eternal Circle of
Natural Products. The Trees, the Flowers, with all the Vegetable Race; the
Birds, the Beaſts, and Fiſhes, with every <hi>Species</hi> of Animals, are
ſo many <pb n="172" facs="tcp:102964:99"/>Remembrancers of our Mortality. Which way
ſoe'er we turn our Eyes, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with freſh Images of Humane
Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And the very Breath, which does prolong our Life, helps equally to
ſhorten it, ſince every Reſpiration carries away ſome Portion of our
Subſtance. Our finer Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles gradually vaniſh into Smoak, and Air,
whilſt the more groſs Remainder ſcums off in noiſome Excrements. And if
there appear a Shew of any thing ſolid in us at our Death, 'tis ſoon
reduc'd to Aſhes, Dirt, or Worms. Our Bodies, of which we make ſo great
Account whilſt living, are loſt in the <hi>Abyſs</hi> of Univerſal
Matter, ſoon after Death.</p>
               <p>What were the greateſt Prince the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, tho' he
poſſeſs'd the whole Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this Globe? 'Tis but a Mighty Heap
of Dirt, or Dung, perpetually exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or crumbling away. 'Tis one of the
Diſhes which compoſe the Banquet of All-devouring Time. And whilſt the
inſulting Monarchs of the Earth trample on it in Diſdain, ſpreading their
Armies far and wide, and boaſting that their Empires have no Bounds; each
do's but haſten to be ſhut up himſelf within a little, obſcure and

               <p>Great <hi>Baſſa,</hi> Let not the Honours and Dignities thou

               <p>Yet with all their Curioſity, none but the Miniſters of

common to all States, to turn the beſt Side outermoſt; only the

               <p>He makes a very Perſonable Figure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tall, Full-body'd,

whether <hi>Greeks, Armenians,</hi> or <hi>Followers of the Prophet:</hi> and
he ſpeaks <hi>French</hi> as readily as a Native. Yet he Diſſembles his
Expertneſs in that Language, to keep up the State and Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedneſs of
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains to condeſcend to any other
Speech, than <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> or <hi>Arabick.</hi> Beſides, he has the
Advantage, by thus artificially ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Ears, that he can at one time
both <hi>hear</hi> and be <hi>deaf; underſtand</hi> and be <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi>
of whatſoever is ſaid by the Spies of <pb n="176" facs="tcp:102964:101"/>the
<hi>French</hi> King. And this is no ſmall Gift in a Man of his Character and
Truſt. For he had need of an <hi>Angel,</hi> or a <hi>Devil</hi> at's Elbow,
that thinks to over-reach this Court.</p>
               <p>Above all, I believe our <hi>Solyman</hi> will never be guilty
of the Error committed by the Embaſſadors ſent from <hi>Tenedos</hi> to
one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors. I'm ſure he is not yet. For, thoſe
Gentlemen had ſeen the Death of the Emperor's Son, Eleven Moons, and Fourteen
Days, as the Story ſays, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew 'twas their Duty to make an
Addreſs of Condolence: Or, at leaſt, before they call'd it to mind; for,
they were drown'd in the <hi>Roman</hi> Luxury. So that, when they came to
perform that <hi>Devoir,</hi> the Emperor cou'd not forbear to Scoff at them in
theſe Terms: <hi>I much lament,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>the Fate of the
Renowned</hi> Hector, <hi>your Country-Man, and Champion, whom</hi> Achilles
<hi>the</hi> Grecian <hi>kill'd above a Thouſand Years agoe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpeak this in a particular Regard to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi>'s
Deportment here. For, when he firſt came to this Court, he found them all in
Mourning for the Death of the King's Aunt, the late Queen of <hi>England,</hi>
and of other High Perſonages (particularly thoſe that were ſlain in the
late Action at <hi>Candia</hi>) whereof I have already given an Account to the
<hi>Sublime Port,</hi> in another Letter. Without Inſtructions he very
demurely accoſted the <pb n="177" facs="tcp:102964:101"/>King, and told him, 
<q rend="inline">"There cou'd be no <hi>Dunalma</hi> in the
<hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, for the late Succeſs at <hi>Candia,</hi> ſo long
as the <hi>French</hi> Court were Mourners."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was a ſenſible Touch to thoſe that underſtood it;
and from that Moment the Grandees and Miniſters of State have made a
Difference in their Entertainment of this Ingenious <hi>Muta-faraca,</hi> and
that which they us'd to give to the <hi>Chiauſes</hi> formerly ſent from
the <hi>Port.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I can aſſure thee, he is, at the ſame time, very Blunt,
and very Elegant, in his Diſcourſe. There's Fire in every word he utters,
to warm and refreſh, if they take it at a due Diſtance; but, if they
approach too near, he ſcorches their Spirits, and puts them into a Choler,
they dare not ſhew. They conſume inwardly in their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight: yet
cannot help themſelves.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, the King of <hi>France</hi> is the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Monarch, the moſt Powerful and Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Prince in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi>
the only <hi>Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Weſtern Franks.</hi> Yet he
veils to our <hi>Majeſtick Sovereign,</hi> Lord of the whole Earth. And our
<hi>Eunuch</hi> will not part with a Tittle of his Maſter's Honour, or give
any Advantage by an Eaſineſs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Blame, in a caſe that may be
turn'd to a Precedent. He is very happy in his Repartees, as thou wilt perceive
by the Anſwer he gave to a <hi>French</hi> Lord yeſterday, when he ask'd
him, Whether he thought it <pb n="178" facs="tcp:102964:102"/>not a Violation of the Civil
Law, for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to be Impriſon'd, as they often are at the
<hi>Ottoman Port? No,</hi> (ſays <hi>Solyman</hi>) <hi>it is not, where the
Embaſſador is guilty of Treaſon, or</hi> Crimen laeſae Majeſtatis.
<hi>But, if it were, you</hi> French-<hi>men have the leaſt Reaſon to
accuſe us of it, ſince we firſt learn'd this Maxim from the Back-ſide
of your</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Law, where 'tis Endors'd.</hi> And then he produc'd
Twenty ſeveral Inſtances of this Kind in the Court of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, <hi>Solyman</hi> has hitherto acquitted himſelf
with Marvellous Succeſs, in every thing; tho' the <hi>French</hi> Grandees
often ſet upon him to try what Metal he is made of, having generally a mean
Opinion of <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans,</hi> becauſe Learning is ſo little
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd among us.</p>
               <p>I have no Matter of News to acquaint thee with, ſave that a
violent Plague broke forth not long agoe at <hi>Soiſſons;</hi> and a
terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Earthquake in <hi>Sicily,</hi> frighted the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of
<hi>Catanea,</hi> and the adjacent Towns, from their Habitations; After one
whole Village had been ſwallow'd up.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who were curious to pry into the Cauſe of theſe
particular Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and that affrighting Overthrow, perceiv'd, after
diligent Search, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a new Eruption, or Breach, in
<hi>Mount Gibell,</hi> about Two Miles from <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea:</hi> Where the
<hi>Horrid Chaſm</hi> vomited forth Floods of Fire, with Flaming Stones; 
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102964:102"/>which being carried violently through the Air, for the
ſpace of near a League round about, at laſt fell down in Flaming Showers,
or <hi>Cataracts,</hi> producing ſad, and Calamitous Effects in the
Neighbouring Country.</p>
               <p>Serene Miniſter, it is evident that the Judgments of
<hi>God</hi> are upon theſe <hi>Infidels:</hi> Yet, they will not be
converted from their Errors, and Vices. They have felt the ſame Tempeſt of
Fire which overwhelm'd the Nine Cities of the Lake <hi>Aſphaltites.</hi> Yet,
they remain Inſenſible and Obdurate. Surely, they will be exterminated from
the Earth.</p>

               <p>BE no longer Melancholly, my Friend, nor ſink under the
Burthen of thy Misfortunes. Give not thy Enemies an Occaſion of double
Triumph in that they have driven thee from thy Self, as well as from the
<hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Happy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Thou haſt Money and Jewels enough
left to purchaſe thee a competent Felicity <pb n="182" facs="tcp:102964:104"/>any where.
Or, at leaſt, thou haſt Vertue, which renders every Place a Paradiſe.
Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate thy ſelf with the other <hi>Exiles</hi> in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Victims
to a <hi>Royal Caprice;</hi> ſuffer'd with all their Immenſe Riches, to
make a Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous and Magnificent Entry into that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis</hi> of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> but ſoon after ſtript of all their Wealth, and Sacrific'd
to the <hi>Court-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice.</hi> So were the Conſecrated Bulls of old,
dreſs'd up in ſtately Equipage, their Horns and Hoofs all gilded o'er with
Gold, adorn'd with Ribbands of coſtly Silks, their Bodies cover'd o'er with
Mantles of Broc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade and Tiſſue, embroider'd with Pearls and Precious
Stones, and trailing on the Pavements of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temple: Whilſt the
Prieſts ſtood ready at the Altar to diſpatch whole <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of
theſe gay Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>Your Caſe is not ſo bad at <hi>Caire,</hi> in that your
Lives are ſpar'd, and you at Liberty to carve new Fortunes to your ſelves,
where e'er you pleaſe. You ought to aid and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel one another in your
Misfortunes. It is a Comfort to the Miſerable, to have Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in their
ſad Eſtate. Inſinuate thy ſelf into the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s Favour. He
may do ſomething to Alleviate thy Grief. He'll mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thy Circumſtances
by his own; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he has but Three Years to enjoy his preſent
Wealth and Grandeur.</p>
               <p>Go to the baniſh'd <hi>Mufti,</hi> if he be living at
<hi>Caire;</hi> deſire his Spiritual Advice: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thou may'ſt receive
in to the Bargain ſome Temporal Advantage from it. He has 
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102964:104"/>a greater Influence on ſome of the <hi>Egyptian
Beys,</hi> than the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> has himſelf. You're all alike
embark'd in one Affliction, whoſe Eſſence do's conſiſt in being
degraded from your former Honours, (tho' in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Degrees) and being
ſeparated from your Friends, that bask in the immediate Luſtre of Imperial
Dignity. It is your Buſineſs therefore now, to find out ſome new Source
of Happineſs: to make New Friends, ſince you have loſt the Old; or, at
leaſt, to prop up one another by a mutual Friendſhip, not to be Broke or
Diſſipated, but by a <hi>Deſtiny</hi> equal to the former. And then you
have no more to do, but proſecute your ſeveral Intereſts, and be
reſign'd to <hi>Fate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for thee, I am particularly ſollicitous; being engag'd
together from our Youth, by a Reciprocal Participation of Good Offices, which
was the Effect of a deep rooted and ſtrong <hi>Sympathy.</hi> The
Agreeableneſs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, united firſt our Souls, and taught us the
Myſterious Leſſons of <hi>Platonick</hi> Love. We ſaw each other, and
were ſtraight inſpir'd with ſacred Inclinations. My Eye no ſooner fix'd
on thine, but through that Perſpective I could ſee the inward Vertue of thy
Soul, which immediately produc'd a Veneration in my Breaſt: And I ſoon
found our Hearts heat Time to one another. This generous Paſſion afterwards
encreas'd as we grew up; and what it loſt of its Firſt Violence, it gain'd
by acquiring a more laſting Strength, more durable Integrity and conſtant
Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. <pb n="184" facs="tcp:102964:105"/>Our Joys and Griefs were ſtill the
ſame. No Proſperous or Adverſe Fortune cou'd ever change our Minds, to
warp us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Flattery or Contempt: But with an even Mind we ſtill
ſuſtain'd the different Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of Humane Life, and propp'd up one
another with tight Affection; till 'twas the Will of Fate to ſeparate us, I
being made a Slave in <hi>Sicily,</hi> whilſt thou enjoy'dſt the Smiles and
Favours of thy Infant-For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which introduc'd thee firſt to the
<hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il'.</hi> Afterwards I gain'd my Freedom, and return'd to the
<hi>Imperial</hi> City, and to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of the <hi>Sultan.</hi> But was not
ſuffer'd long to enjoy that Happineſs, being appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for this hazardous
Poſt in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I tell thee, <hi>Mehemet,</hi> I reckon my Caſe far worſe
than thine, in that I am forc'd to take my conſtant Reſidence up among
theſe <hi>Infidels.</hi> Cou'd my propitious Stars encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me but with the
ſmalleſt Hopes to change my preſent Courſe of Life, I'd ne'er repine at
what is paſt, but pleaſe my ſelf with flattering Proſpects of ſome
future and unknown Felicity. But, to be irrevocably chain'd down to the Oar,
without a Glimpſe of any Sign that I ſhall ever be reliev'd, is worſe
than Death it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Whereas, on the other ſide, thou art diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of in the
happieſt Region of the Earth; <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Mother of
<hi>Sciences,</hi> the Midwife of <hi>Celeſtial Secrets;</hi> the Nurſe of
<hi>Sages, Saints,</hi> and <hi>Prophets;</hi> the Granary of the
<hi>Muſſulman Empire;</hi> and the Refuge <pb n="185" facs="tcp:102964:105"/>of
Diſtreſſed Mortals. Oh! <hi>Mehemet,</hi> prize the vaſt Advantage thou
haſt of me, and others of thy Fellow-Slaves. Improve thy Privilege, and
Opportunity of ranging where thou liſt. Go, viſit all the Antiquities of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and trace her Borders to the <hi>Weſt</hi> and
<hi>South.</hi> If this will not divert thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, go farther yet, and
ſearch the mighty <hi>Cataracts</hi> of the <hi>Nile,</hi> which deafen
Mortals with their Fall. Go view the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the <hi>Moon</hi> in
<hi>Aethiopia:</hi> Or, ſee the Deſolation of the <hi>Smoaky Vale,</hi> and
of the Cities, whoſe Inhabitants were in a Minute <hi>Metamorphos'd</hi> into
Stones, as a Memorial of Eternal Vengeance againſt crying Sins.</p>
               <p>But, after all, my <hi>Mehemet,</hi> depart not from thy
Reaſon, Loyalty and Faith. For theſe are Armour-Proof againſt the
Aſſaults of Chance and Deſtiny, of Men and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, of Earth and Hell.
And when thy Travels are finiſh'd here on Earth, thoſe Vertues will not
fail to carry thee to Heaven.</p>

               <p>There is an Eternal Law fix'd in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, which admits
of no Repeal. No Prayers, or Tears of Paſſionate Mortals; no Vows, Alms,

               <p>Go, make the ſpeedieſt Retreat thou can'ſt, out of the

<hi>Muſſulmans</hi> will terrifie thy Mind and fill thee with a Thouſand
Apprehenſions.</p>
               <p>Go rather the directeſt Way thou canſt, unto the Kingdoms of
the <hi>Negro's</hi> or Black People, inhabiting the <hi>Torrid Zone.</hi> But,
take this Rule: Be ſure to Coaſt along the River <hi>Nile,</hi> as near as
the Roads of <hi>Africk</hi> will permit: That ſo thou may'ſt avoid the
Horrible and Affrighting Deſarts of <hi>Libya, Nubia,</hi> and

Baſilisks, and other Monſters of thoſe Regions. And yet, for ought I

               <p>I know not how to give a General Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Southern

better deſerve the Title of <hi>True Believers,</hi> than we

go by a quite contrary Method. They believe no other <hi>Gods</hi> but their
Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Prieſts, and theſe they never willingly offend. Whereas,
whilſt we profeſs the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> we ſcruple not to ſin

               </head>
               <p>FRom thy Clemency I will not fear a Charge of Negligence, in
that I have delay'd to perform the Task thou enjoinedſt me. Thou know'ſt my
Circumſtances, and wilt conſider, That tho' I have read <hi>Books,</hi> yet
I have not a <hi>Library</hi> of my own. 'Tis true, I often frequent thoſe of
this City, but my Seaſons are limited, either to thoſe Hours when the
<hi>Libraries</hi> are open'd, or to thoſe I can ſpare from the Affairs of
my <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> I cannot ſerve the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> and
follow my Studies both at once. Yet I have out-paſs'd Frugality, and turn'd a
Niggard of my time, that I might obey the great <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>True
Believers,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a <hi>Work,</hi> for which I have ſo
paſſionate a Regard.</p>
               <p>The Enclos'd Paper contains the Size of the <hi>Volume,</hi>
which I conceive will be moſt <pb n="191" facs="tcp:102964:108"/>proper for ſo great a
<hi>Work,</hi> with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of the <hi>Pages,</hi> which I have
divided into <hi>Columns,</hi> that ſo the <hi>Years</hi> of the
<hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Date</hi> of the <hi>Olympiads,</hi> with other
Remarkable <hi>Aera's,</hi> may be rank'd in Order, each Parallell with the
reſt, and all with the Matter treated of at ſuch a Time.</p>
               <p>This I have done in the enclos'd Paper, not thinking it proper
to interrupt the <hi>Series</hi> of my Letter, with a blank <hi>Scheme,</hi>
which is for the Uſe of the <hi>Compilers;</hi> but to preſent thee with a
tranſient View of the <hi>Four Monarchies,</hi> which have made ſuch a
noiſe in the World; wherein thou need'ſt not fear the Fatigue of a tedious
continued Hiſtory; for I deſign only to cull out ſuch Paſſages as are
moſt Diverting, and worthy of Peruſal.</p>
               <p>To begin then with the <hi>Aſſyrian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> which
was the <hi>Firſt</hi> of the <hi>Four:</hi> This <hi>Nation</hi> was, for a
great while, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with its own Bounds, without ſeeking to encroach on
the Territories of others. And <hi>Ninus</hi> was the <hi>Firſt</hi> of the
<hi>Aſſyrian Kings,</hi> who enlarg'd his <hi>Dominions</hi> by
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</hi> He ſubdu'd the greateſt part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and
rais'd <hi>Aſſyria</hi> to the <hi>Title</hi> of an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After his Death, <hi>Semiramis</hi> his Wife, took upon her the
<hi>Government,</hi> counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſon of <hi>Ninyas,</hi> his Son,
who was as yet but a Child. She wore the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of a Man, and being like her
Son, paſs'd <pb n="192" facs="tcp:102964:109"/>for him, as the lawful Succeſſor,
unſuſpected. This <hi>Virago</hi> enlarg'd the <hi>Conqueſts</hi> of her
Husband, and ſpread her <hi>Empire</hi> from <hi>India</hi> to
<hi>Aethiopia;</hi> and to lay the Foundation of an immortal Fame, ſhe built
<hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To her, ſucceeded <hi>Ninyas</hi> her Son, of whom nothing is
Remarkable but his Effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minacy. For neglecting the Affairs of <hi>War,</hi> he
ſpent all his Time among his <hi>Concubines.</hi> And the ſame Stain is
faſten'd on his <hi>Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> even to <hi>Sardanapalus;</hi> in
whoſe Death the <hi>Aſſyrian Monarchy</hi> ſuffer'd an Interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being Cantoniz'd into Petty Royalties, by the <hi>Governours</hi> of
<hi>Provinces.</hi> Among whom, thoſe who aſſum'd the <hi>Crown</hi> of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> were of moſt Note, in regard they firſt recover'd the
broken <hi>Empire</hi> to its Old Grandeur and Unity.</p>
               <p>By a Succeſſion therefore of many <hi>Kings,</hi> in
Reference to whoſe Actions <hi>Hiſtory</hi> is ſilent, the
<hi>Monarchy</hi> deſcended to <hi>Mero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dach Baladan:</hi> In whoſe Days
happen'd that wonderful <hi>Retrogradation</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> mention'd
by <hi>Hebrew Writers</hi> and others, which occaſion'd thoſe Famous
Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi>
of that Age, mention'd in the <hi>Perſian Chronicles.</hi> For they
obſerving, that not only the <hi>Sun,</hi> but the whole <hi>Planetary
Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem,</hi> and all the <hi>Fixed Stars</hi> went back at the ſame Time,
or at leaſt ſeem'd to do ſo, began to revive that curious Queſtion,
about the Motion of the Earth, which the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans,</hi> 
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:102964:109"/>and <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> of <hi>India</hi> had
ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, when the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> ſtood ſtill at
the burning of <hi>Ida.</hi> And it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by ſome of 'em, That the
<hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> being granted, its ſtanding ſtill, or
going back at theſe extraordinary Times, would ſolve all the
<hi>Aſtronomical</hi> Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces better, and in a more Natural Way, than by
ſuppoſing ſuch a Prodigious Stop to be put to the whole
<hi>Coeleſtial</hi> Frame at one time, or that the Everlaſting
<hi>Spheres</hi> ſhou'd be Rowl'd backwards at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>This Diſpute was the Occaſion of that famous Conflux of the
<hi>Eaſtern Sages</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> mention'd in the <hi>Perſian
Poets,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorians.</hi> For <hi>Baladan</hi> being very
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after Knowledge, and particularly deſirous to be inform'd in
the Grounds of this Preternatural Appearance, ſent Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into
<hi>India, Egypt, Perſia,</hi> and all <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> where Learning
flouriſh'd; inviting the <hi>Aſtrologers, Prieſts, Magicians,
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and all that had the Character of <hi>Wiſe-Men,</hi> to come
to his <hi>Court</hi> at <hi>Babylon,</hi> where they were magnificently
entertain'd; and when they had fully ſatisfied all the <hi>King</hi>'s
Demands, he ſent them away laden with Gifts and Preſents, every Man to his
own Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arkianus</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Baladan</hi> in the
<hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Ecbatane</hi> was
built. To him ſucceeded <hi>Belithus, Aphronadius, Rigibelus,
Meſſiſſimerdacus;</hi> 
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:102964:110"/>after whom the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> was again tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> in the
Reign of <hi>Eſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haddon,</hi> in the 3323d. Year of the <hi>World,</hi>
and the 24th. <hi>Olympiad.</hi> During the <hi>Empire</hi> of this
<hi>Eſcharhaddon</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian Monarch, Chalcedon</hi> that lies
over againſt the <hi>Imperial</hi> City, was built by the <hi>Thracians,</hi>
in the 25th. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and 3329th. Year of the World.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Eſcharhaddon</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Saosduchinus,
Chyladanus, Nabopolaſſar;</hi> in the Reign of which laſt, <hi>Necho</hi>
King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to cut a <hi>Canal</hi> from the
<hi>Nile</hi> to the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> wherein he employ'd an Hundred and
Twenty Thouſand <hi>Egyptians;</hi> but diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd by the ſlow
Progreſs they made, and the vaſt Expences he was at, he gave it over.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Nabopolaſſar,</hi> once more rais'd the
<hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> to an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;</hi>
for before his Time it had been for ſome Years in the Hands of the
<hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> but he ſubdu'd all <hi>Syria, Phoenicia, Judaea,</hi>
and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and expell'd the <hi>Scythians</hi> out of
<hi>Aſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To him ſucceeded his Son <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who dreamt
of the <hi>Four <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,</hi> that were to ſucceed one
another. In his <hi>Reign</hi> was born the <hi>Grand Cyrus,</hi> who rais'd
the <hi>Perſian Monarchy.</hi> Of him it is Recorded, That one Night he
dreamed, <hi>The</hi> Sun <hi>ſtood at his Feet, whom when</hi> Cyrus
<hi>Thrice attempted to lay hold on, the</hi> Sun <hi>as often
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd:</hi> Which the <hi>Magi</hi> interpreted, as a 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102964:110"/>ſure Sign that he ſhould Reign Thirty Years, which
came to paſs accordingly.</p>
               <p>During this <hi>Reign,</hi> there was a Notable <hi>Duel</hi>
fought between <hi>Pittacus,</hi> one of the <hi>Seven Wiſe Men</hi> of
<hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Phrynon</hi> the moſt Renowned <hi>Combatant</hi> of
thoſe Days; for he always won the Prize at the <hi>Olympick Games.</hi> He
was <hi>General</hi> of the <hi>Athenians;</hi> and being puff'd up with his
conſtant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, he defy'd any Man to a ſingle <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat.
Pittacus</hi> the <hi>Sage,</hi> accepted the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge; and when they were
hotly engag'd in the Field, he ſuddenly threw a ſilken Net o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Phrynon</hi>'s Head, and having thus entang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, thruſt him through
with his <hi>Lance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was that great <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who having
beſieg'd and taken <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> burnt it down to the Ground, raz'd
the Walls, and carry'd away all the <hi>Jews</hi> with their Riches into
<hi>Captivity</hi> to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards having Conquer'd all the Neighbouring
<hi>Nations,</hi> he new built <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and enclos'd it with Three
Walls: He alſo built thoſe <hi>Pendulous Gardens,</hi> Renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned throughout
the Earth; and made thoſe <hi>Brazen Gates</hi> which were reckoned among the
<hi>Wonders</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> But at length, being puff'd up with the
Thought of his <hi>Magnificent Works,</hi> he was Metamorphos'd into a
<hi>Satyr</hi> or <hi>Sylvan,</hi> and dwelt Seven Years in the
<hi>Deſarts</hi> of <hi>Arabia,</hi> being a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the
<hi>Brutes.</hi> My <hi>Country-men</hi> ſhew the Places of his wild Haunt,
to this Day; having receiv'd it by <hi>Tradition</hi> from their
<hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> 
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:102964:111"/>They ſay alſo, that
<hi>Paremiel,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> of the <hi>Woods,</hi> when the Term of
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years was expir'd, interceded with <hi>God</hi> for
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> who thereupon turn'd him into a <hi>Man</hi> again,
and reſtor'd him to his <hi>Empire.</hi> He dyed peaceably in the 3442d Year
of the <hi>World,</hi> and the 43d of his <hi>Reign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To him ſucceeded <hi>Evil-Merodach, Neri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſſor,
Laboroſoarchod,</hi> and <hi>Labynitus,</hi> in whoſe Time there was
<hi>War</hi> between the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> when
<hi>Cyrus</hi> after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Victorious Campaigns, at laſt laid Siege to
<hi>Babylon,</hi> took the City, and tranſlated the <hi>Empire</hi> to the
<hi>Perſians;</hi> and having ſubdu'd all the <hi>Weſt</hi> of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> even to the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> he died at Seventy Years of Age;
Commanding his Servants not to Embalm his Body, nor uſe any coſtly Pomp at
his <hi>Funeral,</hi> but bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying him decently like a Man, ſhou'd cauſe
this <hi>Epitaph</hi> to be writ on his <hi>Tomb:</hi> 
                  <q>O Mortals, I am <hi>Cyrus</hi> who laid the Foundation of the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchy, and was Emperour of all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia:</hi>
Therefore envy me not a Grave.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To him ſucceeded <hi>Cambyſes</hi> his Eldeſt Son, who
marching with his Army into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> 
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:102964:111"/>and laying
Siege to <hi>Peluſium,</hi> caus'd a great Number of Cows, Apes, Birds and
other Animals to be plac'd in the Front of his Army; knowing, that the
<hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhip'd ſuch for <hi>Gods,</hi> and conſequently
wou'd forbear to ſhoot their Arrows that way: By which Stratagem he took the
City, and afterward Conquer'd all <hi>Egypt,</hi> carrying away many
Thouſands of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> with Foreigners reſiding there, into
<hi>Captivity,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom was <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the
<hi>Philoſopher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> ſent <hi>Spies</hi> under the
Notion of <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opia,</hi>
with Rich <hi>Preſents.</hi> But the <hi>King</hi> ſuſpecting what was
their Buſineſs, took a <hi>Bow</hi> in his Hand and bent it, as tho' he
wou'd ſhoot; and giving it to the <hi>Spies,</hi> he bid them carry it to
their <hi>Maſter,</hi> and tell him, <hi>That when he and his</hi> Perſians
<hi>had learn'd to bend</hi> Bows <hi>of that Strength, he might think of
invading</hi> Aethiopia, <hi>and not before, for that the</hi> Aethiopians
<hi>were Gyants in Vigor.</hi> And when the <hi>Spies</hi> return'd to
<hi>Cambyſes,</hi> there was no Man found among his Soldiers which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to bend that <hi>Bow.</hi> Yet he march'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly toward <hi>Aethiopia</hi>
with a Great Army; Part of which was overwhelm'd in the Sands of the
<hi>Deſarts,</hi> to the Number of Fifty Thouſand, and the Reſt being
reduc'd, for Want of Proviſions, to a Neceſſity of eating one another, he
returned in a great Rage to <hi>Memphis,</hi> where he ſlew <hi>Apis</hi> the
<hi>God</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and caus'd his <hi>Prieſts</hi> to be
Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred. He alſo ſlew his own Brother, and <pb n="198" facs="tcp:102964:112"/>kill'd his Wife becauſe ſhe mourn'd for him. He ſhot
<hi>Prexaſpes</hi> through with an Arrow, and commanded Twelve <hi>Perſian
Nobles</hi> to be bury'd Alive: He ſet Fire to the <hi>Temples,</hi>
blaſphem'd the <hi>Gods,</hi> and at laſt kill'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by an Accident
with his own Sword.</p>
               <p>After his Death, the <hi>Magi</hi> Crown'd one of their own
Order, and ſet him on the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> giving out
that he was <hi>Smerdes</hi> the Younger Son of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who had been
murder'd by the Command of his Brother <hi>Cambyſes.</hi> And it was eaſy
to carry on the Fraud, in regard the <hi>Perſian Kings</hi> rarely ſuffer
themſelves to be ſeen; which is a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, thou knowſt, obſerv'd by
all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs</hi> in the <hi>East.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One <hi>Ostan,</hi> a <hi>Perſian Prince,</hi> firſt
diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd the Cheat by Means of his Daughter, a <hi>Concubine</hi> of the
<hi>King's:</hi> For ſhe, by his Inſtruction, found out, that the
<hi>King</hi> had no Ears: Which was a convincing Argument that he was one of
the <hi>Magi,</hi> whoſe Ears <hi>Cambyſes</hi> had commanded to be cut
off.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Ostan</hi> drawing Six other <hi>Princes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a
<hi>Conſpiracy,</hi> they ruſh'd into the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> and kill'd all
the <hi>Magi,</hi> and ſingl'd out of their own Number, one <hi>Darius,</hi>
the Son of <hi>Hystaſpes,</hi> to ſucceed in the <hi>Throne.</hi> This was
not done by Election, but by Lot: For they agreed to meet all together, one
Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before the Palace Gates on Horſeback; and that he whoſe Horſe
firſt Neigh'd, after the <hi>Sun</hi> was up, ſhou'd be <hi>King.</hi> This
fell to <hi>Darius</hi>'s Share, by the Stratagem of his <pb n="199" facs="tcp:102964:112"/>
                  <hi>'Squire,</hi> or <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Horſe.</hi> Then
the other <hi>Princes</hi> Crown'd him, and made him ſwear by the
<hi>Sun</hi> and the <hi>Fire,</hi> that he wou'd never put them to Death, or
deny them his Preſence.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Darius</hi> finding himſelf curb'd by theſe
<hi>Princes,</hi> was reſolv'd to rid himſelf of ſuch dangerous
Companions. Wherefore he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a <hi>Stove</hi> to be built on purpoſe
for a <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting-Houſe,</hi> and ſo artificially contriv'd that the
Fire-place being under the <hi>Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-Chamber,</hi> ſhould in ſo many
Hours burn aſunder the Pillars that ſupported the ſaid Chamber, and
cauſe the Floor to fall down into the Fire. Then he invited theſe
<hi>Princes</hi> to a <hi>Feast,</hi> which he held in this
<hi>Banquetting-Houſe,</hi> and was merry with them till the Signal was given
for him to depart: At which Time he left them in the midſt of their Mirth;
and within a while after he was gone, the Floor of the Chamber fell down, with
all that were in it, into the Fire underneath, where the <hi>Princes</hi> were
ſoon conſum'd to Aſhes.</p>
               <p>After this, <hi>Darius</hi> manag'd all the Affairs of his
<hi>Empire</hi> without Controul. He rul'd over all the <hi>Provinces</hi> of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> from <hi>India</hi> to <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> containing above a
Hundred <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> He extended his <hi>Conquests</hi> to the
<hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Greece;</hi> and ſetting forth a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
<hi>Fleet,</hi> he ſail'd into the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> and
<hi>Archipelago:</hi> He conquer'd the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands</hi> of the <hi>Aegean
Sea,</hi> reduc'd <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and all the Cities along the
<hi>Helleſpont</hi> and <pb n="200" facs="tcp:102964:113"/>
                  <hi>Propontis,</hi> even
<hi>Byzantium</hi> it ſelf, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Seat of our <hi>August
Emperours.</hi> At length, having Reigned proſperouſly Thirty ſix Years,
he died, and left <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Son to ſucceed him in the
<hi>Throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt, <hi>Great Guide</hi> of the <hi>Faithfull,</hi>
that I have not yet reach'd to the End of the <hi>Perſian Monarchy;</hi>
whereas I thought to have comprehended all the <hi>Four</hi> in one Letter: For

               <p>If thou approveſt what I have written, I will continue thus to

               </head>
               <p>TWas a long time before I could find out the True Secret of
Humane Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. I have for many Years grop'd after it in the Dark; and
when I thought I enjoy'd a Proſpect of it, as clear as of Things we diſcern
in the Light of a Mid-day Sun; that Sun was little better than the <hi>Sol
Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuorum</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> whoſe Beams ſerv'd only to
give a faint Mock-Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering to the <hi>Ghoſts</hi> that wander on this
ſide <hi>Charon</hi>'s Ferry, and like an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> to miſlead
'em up and down in the dark <hi>Suburbs</hi> of <hi>Elyzium,</hi> the Fens and
Marſhes of the <hi>Stygian Lake.</hi> So have I ſtraggl'd, all my Life,
through unknown Ways, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Road to Heaven, yet finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
the <hi>Paradiſe of Fools.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes, I thought, by outward Works of Vertue, to purifie my
Self and gain Perfection. I was punctual in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving every Precept of the
Law; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd not a few Acts of Supererogation. Confiding too much in the
Fidelity, and inviolable Faſtneſs of my Wings, the Force of my Religious
Paſſions, firſt form'd by Nature, afterwards improv'd by Pious Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; I
ſtrove to make Heroick Flights, and <pb n="202" facs="tcp:102964:114"/>ſoar above my
Guide. But, alas! they were mere borrowed Feathers which bore me up ſo long;
dead Artificial Wings, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented to my Soul only by Education, Cuſtom, and
the Practice of my Fathers; a Compoſition of Spiritual Wax, or Glew, which
could not ſtand the Brunt of hot and fiery Tryals, but ſoon diſſolv'd
in my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable, Bold Approaches to the <hi>Sun.</hi> So that, in fine, my
Wings dropt piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal off, and I'd the Fate of <hi>Icarus,</hi> to fall a
Victim to my own obſtinate Zeal, and Raſhneſs.</p>
               <p>Surely our Souls are like the <hi>Augaean</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which no
Humane Power, Art, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, can ever cleanſe, did not the
Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Favourites of <hi>God,</hi> like <hi>Hercules,</hi> teach
us the Method of opening a Canal from Heaven, and letting in the Torrent of the
River of <hi>Purification</hi> from <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Vices, <hi>Hydra</hi>-like, ſtill ſtart Young
<hi>Infant-Heads,</hi> as faſt as we cut off the <hi>Old.</hi> Whereas our
Vertues are like the <hi>Venetian</hi> Treaſure, which being once ſhew'd to
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſador in many Coffers of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Gold, and
Jewels; the Wiſe <hi>Caſtilian</hi> deſiring to ſee the Bottoms of
thoſe Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Cheſts turn'd up; when it was done, made this Remark,
<hi>Your Riches have no Roots, nor grow, like thoſe my Maſter does
poſſeſs i'th'</hi> Indies. So are all the boaſted Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
acquir'd by Humane Diſcipline, more inanimate and dead than the Artificial 
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:102964:114"/>Productions of Minerals, Metals, and Stones. No
<hi>traditional Chymiſtry</hi> of Men, can e'er revive a Soul, that's dead to
<hi>God.</hi> Perhaps, ſome Theological <hi>Paracelſus, Helmont,</hi> or
<hi>Arabian Ifriqui,</hi> may, from the Aſhes of an Original Flower, raiſe
the <hi>Phantaſtick</hi> Form of it again; I mean the Colour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
of the Leaves: But none of them is able to beſtow the <hi>Vital Sap,</hi> the
<hi>Seminal Juice,</hi> the <hi>Inward Vertue</hi> of the once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
and flouriſhing <hi>Vegetable.</hi> No Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal can repair what <hi>Adam</hi>
once deſtroy'd. That <hi>Protoplaſt</hi> has ruin'd us All.</p>
               <p>Well then! Muſt we deſpair of Remedy? Shall we decamp, and
ſneakingly retire to <hi>Hell,</hi> becauſe we can't take <hi>Heaven</hi>
by Storm, nor Undermine it; nor have recourſe to Stratagems; nor Bribe the
Garriſon; or make a Party amongſt the <hi>Coeleſtial</hi> Burg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers? No:
Let's rather lie entrench'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Selves, till Heaven ſhall voluntarily
open its Gates, and Sally forth in Love, to invite and lead us in.</p>
               <p>Oh! Thrice-Happy <hi>Santone,</hi> thou haſt experienc'd what
I ſay. My Reſolution is to follow thee, by ſuffering my ſelf to be
gradually abdicated from the World, and from my own Will. Vouchſafe to
inſtruct me in the Method, leſt Self-Love miſguide me to my Ruine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:102964:115"/>In the mean while, repoſe thou in the
Boſom of <hi>God,</hi> which is the Bed-Chamber of Holy Souls.</p>

               <p>I Shall entertain thee now with a <hi>Medly</hi> of Relations,
ſome containing News of the freſheſt Date, others only informing thee of
Things done many <hi>Moons</hi> agoe, yet pleaſant enough in the Rehearſal.
How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I beg of thee to accept this as a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of my <hi>Devoir</hi>
and Regard; in that I have abundance of Letters to write, many Friends to
gratifie, and cannot ſend the ſame Matter to All. I am forc'd to parcel out
my Intelligence, and ſuit every Letter to the <hi>Genius</hi> and
<hi>Station</hi> of him to whom I Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Knowing therefore thy particular
Inclinations, I ſhall preſent thee with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very Agreeable.</p>
               <p>No doubt but thou art acquainted with the Chriſtians
<hi>Carnaval,</hi> which is a Time of publick Joy, Licentiouſneſs, and
Sport. <pb n="205" facs="tcp:102964:115"/>This Year the King and Queen of <hi>France</hi>
obſerv'd it with wonderful Magnificence.</p>
               <p>Among their other Divertiſements, they were preſented with a
<hi>Play,</hi> wherein Two Rival Princes, by an Ingenious Emulation, ſtrove
to out-vy each other in regaling a Princeſs, equally belov'd by both. The
Repreſentation was very fair, and full of Majeſty. On the Right-hand of the
<hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre</hi> appear'd <hi>Apollo</hi> in the Air, returning to his
<hi>Heaven,</hi> after he had chas'd and routed all the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> with
the Serpent <hi>Python.</hi> On the Left was ſeen the ſame <hi>God</hi> on
the Top of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> in the mid'ſt of the <hi>Nine
Muſes,</hi> ſcattering Flowers on the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi>
which were at the Foot of the Mountain. Then a Veil being drawn a-ſide,
diſcover'd a <hi>Sea,</hi> ſurprizingly natural and fine: In the midſt of
which, the <hi>Gods</hi> of many famous <hi>Rivers</hi> appear'd ſeated on
Rocks, with <hi>Tritons,</hi> and <hi>Cupids</hi> rang'd on each ſide, upon
the Backs of <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phins.</hi> Then from above, amidſt the Clouds, King
<hi>Aeolus</hi> appear'd, laying his ſtraight Commands upon the
<hi>Winds,</hi> that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately retire into their Caverns, excepting
only <hi>Zephyr,</hi> who, for his ſoft and gentle Breezes, was permitted to
be preſent at this Feaſt. After which, came <hi>Neptune</hi> riding in his
<hi>Cockle-Chariot,</hi> drawn by Four <hi>Sea-Horſes,</hi> attended by a
Train of <hi>Gods</hi> that dwell within the <hi>Deep.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Immediately the <hi>Scenes</hi> chang'd into a
<hi>Champain,</hi> repreſenting the Delicious Fields <pb n="206" facs="tcp:102964:116"/>of
<hi>Tempe;</hi> where a moſt excellent and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Comedy</hi> was
acted, to the Satisfaction of all the Court. I leave the <hi>Dances,
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terludes,</hi> and other Novelties to thy Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; aſſuring thee,
that all was Aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and Magnifick.</p>
               <p>But not to entertain thee longer with theſe empty Trifles, I
ſhall now acquaint thee with ſomething of Importance; which is a
<hi>Peace</hi> concluded between this King, and the State of <hi>Algiers.</hi>
On the 2d. of the 3d. <hi>Moon,</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> brought the
Articles of the Treaty to the King, from the Hands of the Marquis <hi>de
Martel,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-General of the <hi>French</hi> Fleet in the
<hi>Mediterranean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou wouldſt know [the Particulars of this Agreement, read
the enclos'd Paper: As for Matter of Fact, all the <hi>French</hi> Slaves at
<hi>Algiers,</hi> were immediately releas'd upon the Signing and Sealing] the
Treaty, and delivered up to the <hi>French</hi> Commander; with ſome
<hi>French</hi> Veſſels alſo which they had ſeiz'd. And ſo
diſhonourable are their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations,</hi> That at the ſame Time they
have yielded up a Ship of theirs, which the <hi>French</hi> had taken from
them, for ever quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all Claim to it.</p>
               <p>In the Beginning of <hi>May,</hi> the King took his Journey to
<hi>Flanders,</hi> to viſit his New Conqueſts there. This put his Enemies
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great Conſternation, fearing that he had ſome Deſign upon them.
They began to be upon their Guard, and prepare for a <pb n="207" facs="tcp:102964:116"/>ſudden Surprize. But the King perceiving their Alarm by his Spies;
ſent them Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, on his Royal Word, That he would do them no
Violence at this Time.</p>
               <p>However, he ſoon after ſent the Mareſchal <hi>de
Crequi</hi> into <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with a force conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable enough to
reduce that Prince to Reaſon, who had not kept his <hi>Parole</hi> with him
in ſeveral Inſtances. The Effect [of this Expedition, was the Reducing
<hi>Pont-a-Mouſſon, Eſpinal, Chaſté, Longwy,</hi> and all the
Principality of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King's Obedience: So
that the poor Duke is forc'd to ſeek his Refuge in Foreign Courts.</p>
               <p>Noble <hi>Aga,</hi> this Duke is not to be Pitied, being very
Ungrateful, and a perfect Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. He owes his Liberty and Life to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> yet could not forbear Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt him. Now he is
deſervedly Chaſtis'd for his Folly. So may all thoſe ſuffer, who
abuſe their Benefactors. But, upon the Benign and Good, may the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of
Heaven reſt till the Splitting of all Things.</p>

               <head>LETTER VI. To <hi>Iſouf,</hi> his Kinſman, a
<hi>Merchant</hi> at <hi>Aſtracan.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Receiv'd thy Letter, and perus'd it with much Complacency,
finding thy Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments very agreeable to Reaſon. Yet give me leave to warn
thee of an Exceſs which thou art running into. For I have had Experience of
its ill Conſequence.</p>
               <p>Thy Loſſes have made thee Melancholy, and the Fraudulent
Dealing of thy Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents, Factors, and ſuppoſed Friends, has taught
thee to declaim againſt Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Men, and Buſineſs: And not only
ſo, but it ſeems thou haſt taken a Reſolution to abandon all Worldly
Affairs, Pleaſures, and Engagements whatſoever, and turn <hi>Faquir,
Eremit,</hi> or <hi>Dervich</hi> at leaſt: For, thou art diſguſted at
<hi>Humane Society,</hi> and weary of all Things but <hi>Solitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, <hi>Iſouf,</hi> theſe are very Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Thoughts, and Pious Reſolves. But, they are not eaſily put in Practice.
They are Undertakings, fit only for perfect Saints, Men of unblemiſh'd Lives,
and free from all Sorts of Vice; Perſons who have a Stock of Temperance,
Chaſtity, Prudence, Juſtice, Fortitude, Patience, Humility, and all the
other Vertues, a Fund of Magnanimity, <pb n="209" facs="tcp:102964:117"/>which can never be
exhauſted by any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, Difficulties, or Perils, that uſually
aſſault and environ ſuch as enter into ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere a Courſe of
Life.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou be able to endure the unrelen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, rigid Cold of
<hi>Winter</hi> in the <hi>Deſart,</hi> where there are no Chimneys, Hearths,
or Stoves, nor any other Method of keeping Fire to warm thee by? Canſt thou
ſuſtain the raging Blaſts of <hi>Boreas</hi> at that Seaſon, or the
killing Tempeſts of <hi>North-Eaſtern</hi> Winds, which blow from far, and
fill the Air, the Earth, and Sea, with baneful Miſts, Froſts, Ice, Snow,
Sleet, and other chilling <hi>Meteors,</hi> out of their <hi>Eternal
Magazines,</hi> within the <hi>Artick</hi> Circle, which <hi>Ovid</hi> calls
the <hi>Frigid Zone?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many other Extremities to which a Man's expos'd in
ſuch a <hi>Solitary</hi> State. Nor wilt thou be leſs liable to
Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences and Hardſhips, if thou ſhould'ſt ramble as a
<hi>Faquir,</hi> up and down the World. Much leſs could'ſt thou endure the
ſad Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints, and Mortifications of a <hi>Convent.</hi> Thou'dſt
hardly live out thy <hi>Novitiate</hi> with Patience. It goes againſt the
Grain of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to obey another's Will, in every trifling Matter that he
commands. Thou muſt not Eat or Drink, but thy <hi>Superiour</hi> will ſet
the Place, the Time, and Manner of thy Diet; which will be irkſome to thy
Free-born Soul. And then thou muſt forſake thy Amorous Pleaſures; for
ever Forſwearing alſo, the very Thoughts of Money, or of being Rich. I 
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102964:118"/>tell thee, thou muſt reſolve to become a
<hi>Religious Drone,</hi> fit for nothing but to <hi>mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> o'er thy
<hi>Beads,</hi> or turn the <hi>Superſtitious Round,</hi> till thou art
Giddy, or Dance an Hour together to the Muſick of a Thouſand <hi>Hue's</hi>
and <hi>Hei</hi>'s, hoarſly croak'd out in <hi>Frantick</hi> Tones, by thee,
and all thy Brethren <hi>Dervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> till ye are ſick, and foam at
Mouth: Then your Devotions are thought Meritorious. Canſt thou digeſt
theſe ſacred Fooleries? Or grant this to be a Rational Service of the
Divinity, as ſome will plead; who ſay, We ought to employ each Member, and
all our Faculties, in Praiſing him that made 'em; yet canſt thou brook a
Confinement all thy Days, to this <hi>Religious</hi> State?</p>
               <p>I tell thee <hi>Iſouf,</hi> I have been often tempted in this
Manner, to forſake the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, with all other Engagements
of the World, and throw my ſelf into a <hi>Convent,</hi> or ſpend the
Reſidue of my Days in ſome obſcure and ſolitary Corner of a
<hi>Deſart:</hi> Yet, I found at length, that this was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but
Deluſion, and the ſubtle Sophiſtry of that Malicious <hi>Daemon,</hi> who
envies Man his Happineſs. 'Tis he that whiſpers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Diſcontent
and Murmuring into our Souls, watching his Opportunities when any Thing gives
us exquiſite Pain or Grief, to drive us to Deſpair.</p>
               <p>So have I ſometimes labour'd under an Intolerable Anguiſh of
Mind, beſides the fretting Maladies of Fleſh, and Blood, with outward
Croſſes in my Fortune. Then <pb n="211" facs="tcp:102964:118"/>have I wiſh'd my ſelf
in ſome dark Cavern of the Earth, or on the ſolitary Top of
<hi>Teneriff,</hi> where I ſhould converſe with none but <hi>Spirits</hi>
and <hi>Daemons</hi> dwelling above the Clouds. Or elſe I coveted the
Melancholy Retirements of the <hi>Lybian</hi> Deſart, which affords no other
Society than that of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tygers, Dragons, and other Beaſts of Prey.</p>
               <p>When theſe Wiſhes have appear'd too Extravagant and Wild, I
then retrench'd my Thoughts, and pitch'd upon ſome other Manner of Life,
equally promiſing Comfort, yet leſs threatning and Dangerous. I gave my
ſelf up wholly to Prayer and Faſting for a while, thinking to hold out thus
for ever. So ſenſible a Pleaſure attends theſe Exerciſes, That at
certain Moments a Man's all Rapture, Ecſtaſy, and I know not what. He is
apt to think himſelf in ſome New World. A Sacred Pride inveſts his Soul.
He ſeems all Majeſty within; an inſeparable Companion of the
<hi>Immortals,</hi> and the Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Friend of <hi>God.</hi> Whereas all this
reſults but from the Ventilation of his Blood, by Vocal <hi>Oraiſons;</hi>
and is no more than a meer Natural Operation, whereby his Lungs are
artificially breath'd, and gently forc'd to Diſembogue their over-heated
Airs, their thick caliginous Vapours, which fill the Heart and all the reſt
of the Vitals with Seeds of Melancholy, Fear, Suſpicion, Grief, and other
doleful Paſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:102964:119"/>But, mark a <hi>Zealot,</hi> when his
Prayers are over, his <hi>Faſt</hi> is done, and all his <hi>Fervent
Pious</hi> Diſcipline is accompliſh'd; how like a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> he
looks and acts: How <hi>formal</hi> is his Carriage, or at leaſt, how
<hi>vain</hi> and <hi>light?</hi> He either heaves out fulſom
<hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack Sighs,</hi> with Supercilious <hi>Looks,</hi> and
<hi>Chaps,</hi> ſet like the <hi>Furrows</hi> of a ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
<hi>Hadgi;</hi> or elſe he's tickl'd into a loud ungovernable Laughter, and
all his Carriage is <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>wanton.</hi> Either his Hunger,
Thirſt, and Faintneſs, the uſual Effect of ſuch Exceſſive Devotion,
makes him Peeviſh, Cholerick, and Unmortified; or elſe he is as
<hi>Apiſh</hi> as a Cat.</p>
               <p>Humane Nature cannot abide long in the ſame Humour, and
thoſe that ſeem to be always Even Temper'd People, like the
<hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> Sea, without <hi>Ebb,</hi> or <hi>Flow,</hi> are only
<hi>Counterfeits,</hi> and <hi>Politicians.</hi> There is an Art to conceal
ones Paſſions, but there is none that can annihilate them. We change from
one Affection, Appetite, and Deſire to another. Our Inclinations circulate
with our Blood. They are transform'd each Minute, Hour, and Day; they vary like
the Wind and Weather. Therefore never think of taking an Eternal Pleaſure, or
Diſtaſte, in any Thing here Below. <hi>Prayer</hi> is good in its Turn, I
mean, the Vocal Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. So are <hi>Faſting, Abſtinence,</hi> and
other Religious Severities. But if all Men ſhou'd be perpetually at theſe
Exerciſes, <hi>God</hi> in a little Time, wou'd have but few 
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102964:119"/>Adorers on Earth. The Ground muſt be left Untill'd; the
Fields would quickly bring forth Crops of Briars and Weeds, inſtead of Corn.
The Gardens then muſt turn to Wilderneſſes. There would be then no need
of Millers, Bakers, and the other Trades, whoſe Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood depends upon the
Husbandman. And ſo for want of proper Suſtenance, Mankind muſt quickly
periſh.</p>
               <p>I do not argue againſt thoſe who ſeem to be Conſtellated
to a <hi>Solitary Life;</hi> or by ſome ſpecial Grace of <hi>God,</hi> are
ſtrengthned to endure the conſtant Hardſhips of an <hi>Hermitage:</hi>
Such as the Illuſtrious and Great <hi>Mohammed,</hi> of <hi>Mount
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel</hi> in <hi>Arabia,</hi> who is our Holy <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Tenant and
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, in the <hi>Cave</hi> of <hi>Wonders.</hi> Such alſo is
<hi>Ilch Rend Hu,</hi> the Celebrated <hi>Bramin</hi> of <hi>Cachemire</hi> in
<hi>India,</hi> who lives on the Top of an High Mountain, is a Hundred and
Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Three Years old, foretells Things to come, reſolves all Doubts, gives
Infallible Counſel, heals divers Diſeaſes, works ſome Miracles; and in
fine, ſays and does all Things by a Spirit worthy of Admiration.</p>
               <p>The Mountain whereon this <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> or
<hi>Prophet</hi> dwells, ſeems to be the <hi>Landmark</hi> between
<hi>Summer</hi> and <hi>Winter.</hi> For one ſide of it is always cover'd
with Snow, the other with Bloſſoms, Flowers, Herbage, and Fruits. This
over-looking a ſpacious Valley, which they call the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of
the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> That affording a Proſpect little more agreeable or fair,
than <pb n="214" facs="tcp:102964:120"/>what the <hi>Poets</hi> ſpeak of the <hi>Riphaean
Hill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ilch Rend Hu,</hi> has his Habitation in a Cave or Grot,
which paſſes through the Rock, as <hi>Virgil's</hi> does near
<hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which thou haſt ſeen.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Myſterious</hi> Station, he appears like
<hi>Aeolus,</hi> Lord of the Weather: For, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he commands the Winds
to blow or ceaſe, at the leaſt word, within the Verge of his accuſtom'd
Walks. If any Perſon dare prophane the Silence of the Place, with Words, or

               <p>IT appears, That the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Fortune not only
procures him conſtant Victories and Triumphs in <hi>Europe,</hi> but ſuch a
Renown and Character in <hi>foreign</hi> Countries, as ſtimulates the moſt
Remote Princes, and Puiſſant Monarchs of the Earth, to court his Alliance
and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Here is at this preſent, an Embaſſador come from the
Coaſts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> being ſent by the King of
<hi>Arder,</hi> one of the Greateſt Sovereigns in thoſe Parts,
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing an Abſolute and Uncontroulable Authority over his
Subjects, as the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> does over the Faithful
<hi>Oſmans.</hi> But, we will not compare the narrow Limits of his Dominion,
with the vaſt and unboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Extent of the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Empire, the
Inheritance of our Sublime <hi>Sultan,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> of the
<hi>Globe</hi> at large. Suffice it, that this <hi>Black</hi> Prince is a
Wiſe Man, deſcended of a Race of Sages; and, that Policy of State is as
natural to him, as common Craft or Cunning to the meaneſt of the Vulgar. He
knows how to make War or Peace abroad, and to keep his Subjects in Awe at
Home.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:102964:121"/>Surely, there is a Force and Charm in the
<hi>Derivative</hi> Blood of Heroick and Wiſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, which ſecretly
inſpires their Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring with Maxims, and Principles, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the
Inclinations, Aims, and Purpoſes of the Family from whence they deſcend.
And where 'tis experienc'd otherwiſe, it may be ſuppos'd That change of
Climates, unhappy Marriages, or ſome over-ruling Misfortunes in the World,
have caus'd the Degeneracy. For ſo ſome Noble Vegetables of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> and other Quarters of the Earth, lying near the Sun, will not
proſper, if once tranſplanted into the Cold and Barren Soils of
<hi>Northern Europe.</hi> Thus Poverty, Diſgrace, and other abject
Circumſtances, chill the Greateſt Spirits, and ſpoil their Growth. Yet
there is an Inborn Excellency in ſome Natures, which with Evenneſs
ſupports the Stroaks of Fortune, and puſhes through all Difficulties to
attain its End.</p>
               <p>So this great <hi>African</hi> King, informing himſelf, not
only by <hi>French</hi> Veſſels Trading in his Ports, but alſo by other
Ships of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,</hi> of the Grandeur of the <hi>French</hi> King,
his Wealth and Puiſſance by Sea and Land, with the vaſt Intereſt and
Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick he has in both the <hi>Indies;</hi> thought it high time to ſeek
his Friendſhip, whoſe Enmity would, in all Probability, be very Fatal to
him: For he had heard of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts far and wide. 'Tis no matter,
whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Valour, or good Conduct, we make our Selves Happy. One is as
laudable as the <pb n="218" facs="tcp:102964:122"/>other, in the unequal War we are engag'd
in, with <hi>Fate, Providence,</hi> and <hi>Chance;</hi> with <hi>Angels,
Men,</hi> and <hi>Devils;</hi> with <hi>Heaven, Earth,</hi> and
<hi>Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſpeak this in reference to the Celebrated Proweſs,
Magnanimity, Riches, and Strength of this <hi>Negro</hi> King; who need not
yield to the King of <hi>Benin,</hi> his next Neighbour, and the moſt Potent
of all the <hi>South-Weſtern</hi> Maritime Princes of <hi>Africk,</hi> nor to
any of his other Neighbours beſides; yet could not think himſelf ſafe, or
be at reſt, till he had ſent this Embaſſy to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> offering his Lands, his Havens, his Seas, and whatſoever was
within his Juriſdiction, to this Great Monarch.</p>
               <p>The Addreſs which his Embaſſador made to the
<hi>French</hi> King, deſerves Remark. For, after the uſual Obeyſances at
the Foot of the Throne, he went up Three Steps, and then proſtrating
himſelf Three times on his Face and Belly; he clapp'd his Hands in token of
Reverence, and put his Fingers on his Eyes, to ſhew, that he was not able to
behold the Luſtre of ſo much Majeſty. This is the <hi>French</hi>
Interpretation of his Carriage: But I tell thee, 'twas rather deſign'd as a
Precedent to the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadors, if any ſhould be ſent to
<hi>Guinea,</hi> where 'tis the Cuſtom of the Country for all
<hi>Foreign</hi> Miniſters, to obſerve the ſame Ceremonies to the King of
<hi>Arder,</hi> and other Princes his Neighbours.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:102964:122"/>Theſe <hi>Europeans,</hi> becauſe they

               <p>THE Grand Root of the Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice which Men are guilty
of, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Beaſts, and of the Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance with which they
corrupt themſelves, I perceive, is a falſe Principle which they have
eſtabliſh'd, denying the Capacity and Uſe of Reaſon to all Living
Creatures but themſelves.</p>
               <p>This Error was firſt publickly maintain'd by the
<hi>Peripateticks, Stoicks,</hi> and <hi>Epicureans;</hi> and afterwards by
<hi>Claudius</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> out of a particular Averſion they had
for the Doctrines of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Empedocles,</hi> Two famous
Patrons of Abſtinence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heraclides Ponticus</hi> undertook to explain the Sentiments
of the former <hi>Sects;</hi> and <hi>Hermachus</hi> thoſe of the Latter.
But, both of them ſeem to confide more in the little Tricks and Arts of
<hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> than to uſe true Reaſon. For at the firſt Eſſay
of their Skill, they ſtrive to caſt a Miſt in the Readers 
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102964:123"/>Eyes, by dividing the Generations of Living Creatures,
into ſuch as are endu'd with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of Reaſon, and ſuch as want it.
Whereas, thou knoweſt, it is an indubitable Maxim in the <hi>Eaſtern</hi>
Philoſophy, That every Thing which partakes of Senſe, has alſo Reaſon.
For, 'tis the Mind alone, which ſees, hears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Body of it
ſelf being deaf, blind, and void of all Senſe. It is evident therefore,
that ſince the Beaſts do ſee, hear, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all other Actions of
Senſe, they have alſo what the <hi>Greeks</hi> call
<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or the Mind in them, which is the
very Seminary, or Native Seat of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, indeed, we cannot affirm, That they poſſeſs a
Reaſon ſo perfect as ours, ſince that Perfection is acquir'd by
Diſcipline, which the Generality of the Brutes want. They have no Colleges or
Schools, where the Arts and Sciences are profeſs'd, and taught by Rules.
Nature is their only School-Miſtreſs, and they learn her Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with abundance of Promptneſs, and Sagacity. They are educated in the open
Elements, as in an Academy, or Univerſity founded by the Creator of all
Things; where every Thing they encounter, ſerves as a Book to teach them all
the Knowledge which is neceſſary to their Well-being on Earth. And they
need no more.</p>
               <p>'Tis manifeſt alſo, That ſome <hi>Species,</hi> and
<hi>Individuals,</hi> are more capable of Learning what is taught 'em, than
others; even as we diſcern the ſame Difference among the 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102964:124"/>various Nations, Families, and Perſons of Men. But we
do not uſe to ſay of Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Things, That this piece of Wood is more apt
to Learn than another, as a Dog is more Tractable and Docile than a Hog: Nor of
Immoveable Things, That this is ſlower than that: Nor of Things which want
Senſe, That a Stone is duller of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion than a piece of Iron. So
could we not properly affirm of Animals, That one is more Crafty and Sagacious
than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; more provident, chaſte, temperate, cleanly, and the like
Epithets; if they were not by Nature, capable of Knowledge and Vertue. And yet
we daily ſee all this true, in comparing one <hi>Species</hi> of Living
Creatures with another; nay, and one <hi>Individual</hi> of the ſame Kind,
with ſome of its Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Antipater</hi> accus'd Aſſes, and Hogs of
Naſtineſs, he did not conſider how accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately Nice and Curious the
Lynxes and Cats are, which, with ſo much Diligence and Care, hide their
Excrements, that they can never be ſeen, or ſmelt again. So the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
teach their Young to mute over the Brims of the Neſt. All which are
Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Prudence and Diſcretion. Doubtleſs, every Animal has
its peculiar Gift, and Excellency. One is more quick-ſighted than another;
This has better Ears than That; a Third ſurpaſſes in the goodneſs of
his Smell, or the ſwiftneſs of his Feet. Let not vain Man therefore
Boaſt, <pb n="223" facs="tcp:102964:124"/>and Inſult, as if he were the ſole
Engroſſer of all Wiſdom and Vertue; ſince the Beaſts of the Field,
the Birds of the Air, the Fiſh of the Sea, with all the Generations of
Rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Inſects, and whatſoever is endu'd with Life and Sence,
poſſeſs their Shares as well as he.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt alſo, That there are various Principles of
Folly, Injuſtice, and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ignorance, Error, and Vice, in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature, equal to what we can poſſibly find in the reſt of Animals, whom
we ſo much deſpiſe. And 'tis a Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even the very
Sea-Horſe, who murders his Father, and for that Reaſon, was by the Ancient
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> made the <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of Impiety; may not
juſtly exchange his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter with <hi>Some</hi> of <hi>Humane Race,</hi>
who make their Parents the continual <hi>Martyrs</hi> to their Ambition, Pride,
Envy, Avarice, and other Vices.</p>
               <p>I would fain know, Whether any Man would not take it ill, to be
told, he is Blind and Deaf, becauſe he cannot ſee and hear ſo quick as
ſome of the Beaſts? Or, that he is a Cripple, becauſe he cannot out-run a
Hart? Certainly, a ſtrong Man deſerves that Character, tho' he cannot
pretend to match the Strength of a Camel, or an Elephant. And ſhall we then
ſay, That the Beaſts have no Reaſon, or Vertue, becauſe they cannot
diſcover thoſe Qualities ſo Artificially as Men?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:102964:125"/>Beſides, Do not all Privations
ſuppoſe ſome Habits? And is not Madneſs a Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Habits of
Reaſon and Prudence? If therefore Dogs, Bulls, Foxes, and other Animals are
known to be ſometimes Mad, Shall we think it leſs fit to ſay of them,
That they are out of their Minds, or Wits, than to affirm the ſame of Men?
And if <hi>Compos,</hi> or, <hi>Non Compos Mentis</hi> are proper
Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of any Beaſt, when it is Sober, or Mad; Who, that is not
depriv'd of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> himſelf, can deny, that they have the
Poſſeſſion of that <hi>Faculty</hi> by Nature, as well as he?</p>
               <p>As oft as I trouble thee with Letters on this Subject, thou
may'ſt conclude, I am newly awaken'd to a Senſe of my Error, in not
Religiouſly obſerving the <hi>Sacred Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of

Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Gold in Yearly Revenue: When ſhe kept in Conſtant Pay, at Home
and Abroad, Six hundred, Five and forty thouſand Men. Her Foreign Conqueſts
may be number'd by her Domeſtick Triumphs; which from <hi>Romulus,</hi> her
Founder, to <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> were no leſs than Three hundred.
<hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the <hi>Publick Treaſury,</hi> with Forty

Four thouſand One hundred and ſeventeen Slaves, Three thouſand and

               <p>THis Day, ſomething has happen'd to me very Prodigious, and I
know not what to make of it. About the Hour of <hi>Quindinamaſi,</hi> I was
ſuddenly taken with ſtrange Fits of Vomiting: My Stomach was in a
<hi>Prodigal,</hi> or rather a <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; reſolving to
caſt off all Superfluities, and only retain what was neceſſary to its
Eaſe and VVelfare in this Life. I labour'd under a Thouſand Horrid Agonies,
which made me fear, that either an <hi>Impoſthume</hi> was the Cauſe of
ſuch violent <hi>Convulſions;</hi> or at leaſt, that they would end in
opening the inward Sluces of my Blood, by too much forcing of the
<hi>Pectoral</hi> Veins.</p>
               <p>VVhilſt I were buſied thus with ſad Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of a
ſudden Death, (for I dread to be ſo unawares thruſt out o'th VVorld) I
long'd and paſſionately languiſh'd for an <hi>Arabian Orange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It happen'd at the ſame Time, my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Oucoumiche,
Daria</hi> and <hi>Eliachim</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> were with me in my Chamber,
and had been there an Hour. They all ſtood at the VVindow to ſee a
<hi>Proceſſion</hi> that was going by. But when they heard the ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Noiſe I made, immediately they ran to <pb n="232" facs="tcp:102964:129"/>my Bed-ſide, as
<hi>Human Nature, Curioſity,</hi> or <hi>Paſſion,</hi> uſes to prompt
in ſuch like Caſes.</p>
               <p>With a faint broken Voice I told 'em what I wiſh'd for
<hi>Eliachim</hi> forthwith gives Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Boy that waited in an
<hi>Anti-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to run with ſpeed, and buy the beſt <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian
Oranges</hi> he cou'd find.</p>
               <p>The arch Young Lad was gone full Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Minutes by my Watch,
and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with Half a Dozen <hi>Oranges</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> (for
he could get no other.) But <hi>Heaven,</hi> as I have Reaſon to think,
ſupply'd his Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and unſucceſsful <hi>Mercating.</hi> For long
before he came with that <hi>ſowre crabbed Fruit, Daria</hi> ſpy'd an
Orange of <hi>Arabia</hi> on the Table.</p>
               <p>No body knew from whence it came, or what kind Hand had laid it
there. They were all equal Witneſſes, That there was no ſuch Thing upon
the Table, when they came to the Bed-ſide, nor a conſiderable Time
afterward: And when it was ſuggeſted, that ſome one of the Company had
privately convey'd it thither, whilſt the reſt were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another way;
<hi>Eliachim</hi> with ſolemn Vows and Imprecations clear'd himſelf; ſo
did <hi>Daria,</hi> and my Mother. As for my ſelf, they all were ſenſible
it was impoſſible for me to do it, as I lay in my <hi>Bed.</hi> A Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Aſtoniſhment poſſeſs'd us all; and the Women would needs have it to
be a <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> whilſt I greedily eat the <hi>Delicious Fruit,</hi>
not troubling my Thoughts with making endleſs <hi>Scrutinies,</hi> or ſo
much as caring which <pb n="233" facs="tcp:102964:129"/>way it came there, ſo long as I
had the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it.</p>
               <p>Yet I ceas'd to be thus Indifferent, when I perceiv'd my
<hi>Malady</hi> on a ſudden remov'd by eating of this <hi>wondrous
Orange.</hi> And whereas I had lain for Six whole Days and Nights in a
continual faint and languiſhing Condition, not able to get down a Morſel of
Bread, now my Spirits grew brisk and freſh; I ſeem'd like one transform'd,
or in another VVorld. My Stomach reviv'd, my almoſt diſſipated Vigor
rally'd, and I roſe chearfully to eat a hearty <hi>Supper.</hi> Theſe
Things, I muſt confeſs, put me, as well as the reſt of the Company, upon
thinking.</p>
               <p>I tell thee, upon the ſtricteſt Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſible, I
am very well ſatisfied, that there cou'd be no Deſign, or Trick i'th'
Caſe: For if there were, no body would be guilty of ſo many repeated horrid
Perjuries in denying it: But every one rather would have been forward to own
themſelves the Inſtruments of thus happily and unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſcuing a
poor ſick Man, from the very Jaws of Death: For I was juſt then ready to
expire.</p>
               <p>VVhether there be <hi>Magick</hi> in the ſtrength of a Man's
Fancy at ſuch Times; and that through the Intenſe Agitation of his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<hi>Sympathy</hi> to exert ſome of its hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and uncommon Faculties, and

<hi>Officious Beings Inviſible</hi> about <pb n="234" facs="tcp:102964:130"/>us, who have
the Charge of <hi>Mortals</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them, and are bound by the Laws of
their conceal'd <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to aſſiſt us in Extremities, even to
the Height of a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Miracle,</hi> where it cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
I know not. But 'tis certain, any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Man may take notice of ſome
extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Paſſages in the Courſe of his Life, of which he can give
no Rational Account, but muſt be forc'd to put 'em on the Score of
<hi>Praeternatural Cauſes.</hi> Such is our Ignorance of the <hi>Secret</hi>
Operations of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Company were ready to liſt me among the
<hi>Prophets;</hi> or in the Catalogue of <hi>Saints,</hi> for this
ſtupendous Occurrence. But I had other Thoughts of my Self: For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
this with ſome former Occurrences of my Life, I preſently concluded, 'twas
the Fore-runner of ſome grand, but ſhort Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And ſo I told them
All.</p>
               <p>I believe, my <hi>Dgnet,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> will hedge me in
with diverſe Kinds of Adverſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: He'll ruſh upon me on a

exterminate the <hi>Moors</hi> from <hi>Spain.</hi> There is a Natural and
Irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable Antipathy between the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
They mutually abhorr each others Cuſtoms, Laws, and Humours: But, above all,
the <hi>French</hi> can ne'er be reconcil'd to that <hi>Infernal Court,</hi>
which tyrannizes o'er the Souls of Men, and puniſhes them for Thoughts. It is
an equal Crime to ſpeak, or to be ſilent; to pray, or not; to go to

Rich. 'Tis Wealth the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> aim at, not the pretended Safety

               <p>Therefore the <hi>Dominicans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
look'd upon as Favourers and Patrons of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and for

               <p>They go to <hi>Church,</hi> but not to babble o'er a Thouſand

any other Exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Form of blind and lame Devotion: But with inward
Recollection, Silence, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and fervent Application of the Spirit, they
addreſs themſelves to <hi>God;</hi> or rather by a certain gradual
Paſſiveneſs, Oblivion of Outward Things, and dying to themſelves, they
prepare and fit their <hi>Souls</hi> for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Approaches: Thus having
barricado'd up their Senſes, and made Retrenchments round the Center of the
Mind, to ſecure it from the laſt Invaſion, and Aſſault of Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane

This is the ſtreight and narrow Bridge, o'er which each Soul muſt paſs

<hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> among the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
Orpheus,</hi> and <hi>Heſiod,</hi> recommended it in their Myſterious
Verſe. <hi>Empedocles, Theophraſtus, Plato, Plotinus, Porphyry,

aſſerted it. The <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Arabian Doctors,</hi> before
and ſince the <hi>Holy Flight,</hi> have been its Advocates: And let not Envy
refuſe to give ſome of the <hi>Chriſtian Prieſts</hi> their due
Acknowledgment, who preach'd this Doctrine in the Primitive Aſſemblies,
taught it in the Publick Schools, and enſur'd it to Poſterity in Learned
Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts. Such were <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Ammonius, Clemens</hi> of

agree in this, notwithſtanding their other Ceremonial and Speculative
Differences; Doubtleſs it is the Voice and Will of <hi>God,</hi> not the

               <p>Reverend <hi>Effendi,</hi> It is a common <hi>Proverb</hi> among

               <p>AFter all my <hi>Scepticiſms,</hi> I at this Hour believe,
there's <hi>Something</hi> of us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains <hi>Immortal,</hi> and
<hi>Incorruptible,</hi> when our <hi>groſſer Bodies</hi> are diſſolv'd.
Call it what you will, an <hi>Aſtral Body,</hi> a <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> a
<hi>Spirit,</hi> or any Thing elſe, I'm ſenſible ſome Part of us will
<hi>never</hi> die. What ſignifies the vain Diſpute of Words, the dark
Reſolves of <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Cave?</hi> Let it be <hi>Subſtance</hi> or
<hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Matter</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> or a Reſult of all; There's
ſtill a certain Portion of our Nature, againſt which the Stroak of
<hi>Death,</hi> and of Ten Hundred Thouſand Deaths, can ne'er prevail. We may
be <hi>chang'd</hi> indeed, and <hi>maſquerade</hi> it up and down, perhaps,
through <hi>Infinite Worlds,</hi> in ſo many different Diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: But we
can never be <hi>annihilated,</hi> or made <hi>Nothing.</hi> We cannot be
excluded from the Eternal Liſt of <hi>Atomes.</hi> The Loſs or Abſence of
the leaſt <hi>Particle</hi> from the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> would either
cauſe the Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt never-ending Thunders and Lightnings, or an
Everlaſting Silence, Sullenneſs and Darkneſs. This mighty Aggregate, and
Stupendous Heap of <hi>Beings,</hi> would fall to Ruine, if there were the
leaſt <hi>Vacuum,</hi> or <pb n="243" facs="tcp:102964:134"/>the ſmalleſt
<hi>Mite</hi> miſſing. Steal but the moſt <hi>Indiviſible Atom</hi>
from the reſt, and down comes <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Fabrick:</hi> For one
ſupports ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an <hi>Inſeparable</hi> Adheſion,
<hi>Reciprocal</hi> Congruity, and <hi>Mathematical</hi> Fitneſs. They are
ſo cunningly hitch'd and knit together, ſo cloſely faſten'd and
indented each with other, by the <hi>Original</hi> Art, or Chance which form'd
the World, that all the Motions of this <hi>Grand Machine</hi> would at an
inſtant ſtop, in ſuch a Caſe; as does a Watch, when the leaſt Tooth
is miſſing from any one of the contiguous Wheels. Every Thing in Nature, is
full and pregnant. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be any other <hi>Emptineſs,</hi> ſave
what we think we ſee in Bottles, or other Hollow Veſſels; which when they
are <hi>void</hi> of Water, Wine, or other Liquors, it is but to be cramm'd
brim-full of <hi>Air,</hi> which <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> inſinuates and crowds it
ſelf into each Diminutive Crany, Chink, and Pore of <hi>groſſer
Subſtances:</hi> So if the <hi>Airy Atomes</hi> have any
<hi>Hollowneſſes</hi> in 'em, the ſmalleſt <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy</hi>
poſſible is ſtill ſupply'd with its full Meaſure of the purer
<hi>Aether,</hi> and that again, with ſome Matter more refin'd, if any ſuch
there be, or elſe it drinks full Draughts of <hi>Immaterial
Eſſences:</hi> and by ſuch a <hi>Sub-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Gradation,</hi> Humane
<hi>Souls,</hi> though in themſelves, perhaps, pure <hi>Incorporeal
Spirits,</hi> are yet faſten'd and cemented to our Bodies. Thus is one
<hi>Being</hi> ſucceſſively, and Eternally, either a Syringe, or a Sponge
to another. The <hi>Elements</hi> inebriate one another by Turns; 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:102964:135"/>an Univerſal <hi>Epicuriſm</hi> and Drunkenneſs
Reigns.</p>
               <p>So the Hot Stomach of the Earth, parch'd with Inward Mineral
Fires, greedily guzzles down the very ſalt unpalatable Lees of the Sea,
rather than be adry: With a Thouſand Thouſand gaping Throats, it gulps the
<hi>Beverage</hi> which <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Deep and Mighty Cellar runs withal.
It pants, and ſucks eternally, the thick ropy Settlements of the
<hi>Ocean's</hi> Bottom. Theſe are diſtill'd again in hidden <hi>Limbecks,
Cylinders,</hi> and other <hi>Chymical</hi> Veſſels below, that ſo the
gaping Channels on the <hi>Superficies,</hi> may be conſtantly ſupply'd,
with more refin'd Liquor, through the <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Fountains:</hi>
And yet the <hi>Globe</hi> not having quench'd its Thirſt with this perpetual
Draught, continually ſups up the Rain, a Liquor more ſublime and pure than
all the reſt. But this is only on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Holy-days</hi> of
<hi>Fate,</hi> when the <hi>Celeſtial Powers,</hi> the <hi>Planets,
Stars,</hi> and <hi>Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> order a <hi>Dunalma</hi> for the
<hi>Vegetable</hi> Race Below, to refreſh the Herbs, the Corn, and Trees,
with Banquets from the <hi>Clouds.</hi> Then the Big-belly'd Tuns above are
rowl'd out of their hidden Store-houſes, and broach'd; the <hi>Conduits</hi>
of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Region</hi> ſpout and run with plentiful Showers and
<hi>Cataracts</hi> of Nature's Seminal Juice, the Radical All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chearing
<hi>Nectar</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> The greedy Soil imbibes the ſacred
ſtrong <hi>Caſcade;</hi> each joyful Turf is frolickſome, and ſwallows
down large Bumpers of the <hi>Elemoſynary</hi> 
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:102964:135"/>Wine.
Whilſt the leaſt <hi>dry</hi> and crumbling <hi>Lump</hi> of the late
fainting <hi>Glebe,</hi> has Drops and <hi>Supernaculum's</hi> enough to revel
on; till party-colour'd <hi>Iris,</hi> the <hi>Major-Domo</hi> in theſe
Yearly <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> perceiving the tender Seeds and Roots are well
nigh fuddl'd with what at Second Hand they have exhauſted from the over-laden
Ground, makes her Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> inviting all the Gueſts
to a ſplendid Collation of warm <hi>Beams</hi> and <hi>Rays,</hi> with which
the <hi>Sun</hi> is minded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale them.</p>
               <p>A grateful, ſoft and chearful Noiſe was heard throughout the
Room before. The <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> were in a merry Humour. Well
pleas'd with the Debauch, they would have ſat till Morning at it, being loth
to leave their Liquor behind 'em, or change it for dry Meat. But at the ſight
of <hi>Iris,</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one chang'd Countenance; an univerſal
<hi>Murmur</hi> ran throughout the <hi>Hall;</hi> they were ſorry thus to be
baulk'd i'th' midſt of all their Mirth. Till courtly <hi>Zephyrs</hi> come
with their ſoft Compliments, and tell 'em, It is neceſſary for their
Eaſe and Health: Then are the Tuns, and Bottles remov'd, with all the drunken
Tackle. The Table ſoon is ſpread, and cover'd with a Rich Courſe of
glittering Chargers, ſent from <hi>Phoebus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Sponging Planet</hi> only lives by <hi>Bante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi>
and <hi>Wheedles.</hi> The Illuſtrious Figure he makes i'th' World, is always
borrow'd. He never wore a <hi>Faſhionable Dreſs</hi> in's Life, 
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102964:136"/>but what he took up by <hi>Tally</hi> from the
<hi>Firſt Source</hi> of <hi>Lights:</hi> For which he's bound to pay ſo
vaſt an Intereſt, that he would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily become a Bankrupt, did he
not repair his <hi>broken Fortune,</hi> by playing Tricks upon the
<hi>Earth.</hi> Thus whilſt he mocks this <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary</hi> World, with his
pretended Treats, he makes it pay for all, with coſtly <hi>Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
He plunders the <hi>Elements,</hi> picks the Pockets of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and
robs the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries of the <hi>Sea:</hi> Nor can he forbear fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
ſomething from the <hi>Air;</hi> and when he has ſtollen enough, he
ſlinks away i'th' Dark, and flies to th' other ſide of the <hi>Globe;</hi>
there to commence New Shams and Cheats upon the <hi>Antipodes.</hi> And all the
while, the <hi>Stars</hi> are full as bad as he: For like a Brave
<hi>Highway-man,</hi> that <hi>Luminary</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents the Publick Road of
Heaven by Day; he robs in open ſight of all the World, and leaves a generous
<hi>Viaticum,</hi> where-ever he borrows any Thing. But the <hi>Stars,</hi>
thoſe little <hi>Bullies</hi> of the <hi>Sky,</hi> are perfect
<hi>Night-Pads, Shop-lifts,</hi> and <hi>Sharpers;</hi> they skulk about i'th'
Dark, through all the private <hi>Alleys</hi> of the <hi>Firmament,</hi> and
commit a Thouſand Murders, Rapes, and other Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences. Some of their
<hi>Aſpects</hi> are as veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as the Fatal Eyes of <hi>Baſilisks;</hi>
they carry divers Kinds of Mortal Poyſons in their Looks, which they
diſperſe at Random in this lower <hi>World.</hi> They ſtrew the
<hi>Earth</hi> with <hi>Hemlocks, Aconites,</hi> and other <hi>baneful</hi>
Weeds. They alſo ſcatter up and down, the more <pb n="247" facs="tcp:102964:136"/>contagious Seeds of Envy, Avarice, and a Thouſand black Infernal
Vices, which take Root in Humane <hi>Souls,</hi> at our Nativities; and growing
up with us, in time bring forth the fatal Fruits of Death. The ugly Race of
<hi>Dragons, Serpents, Crocodiles,</hi> and all the <hi>Reptile</hi>
Generations, with every Thing that's Hideous, Cruel, and Deſtructive on the
<hi>Globe,</hi> derive their Natures, Qualities, Forms, and Diſpoſitions
from ſome <hi>Malignant Stars</hi> or <hi>Conſtellations,</hi> if
<hi>Aſtrologers</hi> ſay true. So do the <hi>Scaly Monſters</hi> of the
<hi>Vaſt Abyſs;</hi> and every <hi>Bird</hi> of <hi>Horrible Figure</hi>
flying in the <hi>Air.</hi> They're all the Brood, the Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, Spies,
and Agents of the <hi>Powers</hi> Above, ſent down on Thieviſh Errands, to
prey on other Animals, more innocent than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>There is an <hi>Eternal Chace</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> whilſt
every thing is either on the Hunt or Flight. Thus <hi>Heaven</hi> purloins from
<hi>Earth,</hi> and that from <hi>Heaven</hi> again. When we are firſt
conceiv'd, our wandring <hi>Souls</hi> are catch'd, as in a well-baited Trap.
And when we dye, 'tis but the <hi>Soul</hi>'s Eſcape from One Snare to be
ſoon trapann'd into Another. Perhaps a <hi>Humane Body</hi> may be our
Priſon again, or we may be attracted by ſome more agreeable
<hi>Embryo.</hi> This <hi>Magnetick Star</hi> may draw us up to
<hi>Heaven,</hi> or the wide <hi>Jaws</hi> of all-devouring <hi>Orcus,</hi> may

               </head>
               <p>IN Obedience to thy Commands, I ſhall now proceed in relating
the moſt Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Tranſactions of <hi>Former Ages,</hi> during the
<hi>Four Great Monarchies,</hi> obſerving thy Inſtructions not to be
prolix, or over-curious in tracing down the particular <hi>Succeſſions</hi>
of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes;</hi> but rather to relate the
<hi>Actions</hi> of <hi>Famous Men,</hi> the <hi>Wiſe Sayings</hi> of the
<hi>Ancients,</hi> with ſuch other Remarks, as may be at once Delightful and
Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
               <p>'Twill be no Breach of this Rule, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin where I left off in
my Former Letter, with the Death of <hi>Darius,</hi> and
<hi>Succeſſion</hi> of <hi>Xerxes</hi> his Younger Son, there being
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Nicety in the Plea between him and his Elder Brother
<hi>Artabazanes</hi> for the <hi>Crown:</hi> For this laid Claim to it on the
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his <hi>Primogeniture:</hi> But in regard he was born before
<hi>Darius</hi> was made <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> was
determined in favour of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who had a Double Advantage, in being
begot by a Crowned <hi>King,</hi> and born of <hi>Atoſh,</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> who firſt Eſtabliſhed this <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Xerxes</hi> was ſetled in the
<hi>Throne,</hi> he lead an Army into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſuppreſſed the
Inſurrections in that Countrey. Then <pb n="250" facs="tcp:102964:138"/>he fitted out a
Fleet of 4200 Ships, on Board of which were above Five hundred thouſand Men.
He had a Land Army alſo, conſiſting of Two Millions, and Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand Soldiers of ſeveral Nations. With this vaſt Multitude he march'd
againſt the <hi>Graecians;</hi> and to facilitate the Voyage of his Fleet, he
cauſed one Part of his Army to dig a Paſſage through Mount
<hi>Athos,</hi> whereby the Sea was let in, and the Ships might ſail Two
a-breſt; whilſt another Part of the Soldiers, were employ'd in building a
Bridge of Boats over the <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> No ſooner was this done, but
there aroſe a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Tempeſt; which ſo diſcompos'd thoſe
<hi>Narrow Seas,</hi> that between the Winds and Waves, the Boats which made
this Bridge, were all diſpers'd, broken, and caſt away.</p>
               <p>This ſo incens'd <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Sea
to be ſcourg'd with Whips, and a Chain to be thrown into it, as a Mark of its
future Subjection. He alſo Beheaded thoſe who built the Bridge, and
cauſed others to make a new One.</p>
               <p>Here one of <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> and a Particular
<hi>Favourite</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> ſent for a <hi>Graecian</hi> of the
<hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Chios,</hi> who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly depriv'd him of the
Evidences of his <hi>Virility.</hi> And the Old Man coming with his Sons to
wait on this great <hi>Courtier,</hi> the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> caus'd him firſt
to Caſtrate his own Sons, and afterwards forced them to do the ſame by
their Father, in revenge of his own Loſs, and Diſgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:102964:138"/>From hence <hi>Xerxes</hi> marching with
his Army by the Place where once ſtood the Famous Town of <hi>Troy,</hi> went
in <hi>Pilgrimage</hi> to the <hi>Tomb</hi> of <hi>King Priamus,</hi> where he
ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd Ten <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of Oxen, to the <hi>Ghoſts</hi> of the
<hi>Ancient Heroes,</hi> and to the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the River
<hi>Scamander,</hi> which his Soldiers drank dry, and yet half of them had not
quenched their Thirſt.</p>
               <p>After this, he came to the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> where taking a
Survey of all his Land and Sea-Forces, which cover'd the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi>
and all the Neighbouring Shores; and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the Shortneſs of Man's
<hi>Life,</hi> and that of ſo Innumerable a Multitude, not one ſhould be
alive at an Hundred Years End, he Wept bitterly.</p>
               <p>Then having ſacrific'd to the <hi>Sun,</hi> for the good
Succeſs of his <hi>Expedition,</hi> he caus'd all his Army to paſs over the
<hi>Helleſpont</hi> by his Bridge of Boats; after which they drank their Way
through another River, which had not Water enough to ſatisfie half his Men
and Cattle: For his Army encreas'd all the Way, by the Acceſſion of
Soldiers out of every <hi>Nation</hi> through which he paſs'd. Yet
<hi>Leonidas, King</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> with a ſmall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of 4000
<hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi> gave Battle to the whole Army of <hi>Xerxes.</hi> And
in a Sea-Fight at <hi>Salamis,</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> loſt 500 Ships,
with a conſiderable Part of their Army; which, with other Diſaſters of
Sickneſs, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo terrified this Great
<hi>Monarch,</hi> 
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:102964:139"/>that he poſted back again, as faſt
as he could, by the Way of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> which he croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in
a poor Fiſher-Boat all alone, leaving <hi>Mardonius</hi> to purſue the
<hi>Wars</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> But an ill Fate attended their Arms; for at
<hi>Platea,</hi> the <hi>Graecians</hi> ſet upon them under
<hi>Pauſanias</hi> their <hi>General,</hi> and routed the whole Army, Killing
above Two hundred thouſand of them upon the Spot, and Burning their Camp, and
Navy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> hearing theſe ill Tydings, fled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his
own Country, and by the Way ſet Fire to the <hi>Temples</hi> of the
<hi>Gods</hi> at <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and other <hi>Parts</hi> of
<hi>Aſia,</hi> ſparing none but that Magnificent <hi>Fane</hi> at
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> which was Renowned throughout the whole World.</p>
               <p>About this Time dyed <hi>Pagapates,</hi> the faithful
<hi>Eunuch</hi> of <hi>Darius,</hi> who had paſſed Seven whole Years
<hi>Mourning</hi> at the <hi>Tomb</hi> of his <hi>Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt not omit the Treachery of <hi>Pauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi> the
<hi>Lacedaemonian General,</hi> who held a Private Correſpondence with
<hi>Xerxes.</hi> And having been Twice accuſed of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and as
often acquitted, was the Third time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by a Boy whom he kept as his
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and, by the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> was ſtarved to
Death.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt forbidden me to augment the Bulk of theſe
<hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Letters, with Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or Remarks of my own, or
elſe it were a proper Occaſion to put thy <hi>Holyneſs</hi> in 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102964:139"/>Mind, how great a Value ought to be ſet on a Faithful
Man, and let <hi>Nature</hi> it ſelf plead my Excuſe for entrenching on thy
Orders; whilſt I vindicate my ſelf from the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Envious, and
beg of thee to reſt aſſured, That no Man on Earth can be truer to his
Truſt, than the <hi>Arabian</hi> Slave <hi>Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Xerxes,</hi> He was Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dealt
with by the <hi>Captain</hi> of his <hi>Guard;</hi> who, by the
Aſſiſtance of <hi>Spamitres</hi> the King's Chamberlain, and Seven other
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, kill'd him in his Bed with his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son <hi>Darius,</hi>
and crowned <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> in his ſtead.</p>
               <p>To him fled <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who
was ſuſpected a Partner in the <hi>Treaſon</hi> of <hi>Pauſanias.</hi>
The King received him into his Favour, and made him <hi>Governour</hi> of a
<hi>Province,</hi> adding the Gift of Five Great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to furniſh him with
Money for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of his Table and Wardrobe. And this the King did, not
as a Reward or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> (from which he knew
<hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was free, being falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the
<hi>Athenians</hi>) but he heaped thoſe Honours on him, as a Debt to the
Merits of that once Illuſtrious Enemy, now become a Friend, and ſeeking
ſhelter in the <hi>Perſian Kingdom,</hi> from the Barbarous Ingratitude of
his own Country-men; who, for all his Eminent Services to <hi>Greece,</hi>
could think of no better Acknowledgement, than to put to <pb n="254" facs="tcp:102964:140"/>death as a <hi>Traytor,</hi> the Braveſt and Wiſeſt
<hi>Captain</hi> of that Age.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, the <hi>Perſians</hi> loſt 200 Ships in
a Sea-Fight with the <hi>Graecians,</hi> and were routed at Land by a Stratagem
of <hi>Cimon,</hi> the <hi>Graecian General,</hi> who, after the Naval Victory,
put his Men aboard the <hi>Perſian</hi> Veſſels which he had taken, and
apparelling them in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Captives, landed
them near the Enemies Camp in <hi>Pamphylia;</hi> who taking them for Friends,
ſuffer'd them to enter their Trenches without Jealouſie, and ſo were all
ſlaughtered, except a few who eſcaped by the ſwiftneſs of their
Horſes.</p>
               <p>About that Time, <hi>Pericles</hi> was made <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Athens,</hi> of whom I made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my former Letters. And
<hi>Themiſtocles</hi> being made General of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army, and
ſent againſt the <hi>Graecians;</hi> rather than fight againſt his
<hi>Country,</hi> or betray the Cauſe of his <hi>New Maſter,</hi> became a
Voluntary <hi>Victim</hi> to his own Integrity and Honour: For, ſacrificing a
<hi>Bull</hi> in his March, he drank off a Bowl of the Blood, and fell down
Dead at the Foot of the <hi>Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next <hi>War</hi> the <hi>Perſians</hi> were engag'd in,
was with <hi>Egypt;</hi> where, in a Battel near <hi>Memphis,</hi> they loſt
a Hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men. But ſending freſh Recruits, they dryed up the
River <hi>Nile,</hi> where the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Fleet, Confederate with the
<hi>Egyptians,</hi> lay at Anchor. Which ſo amazed the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
that they made their <hi>Peace</hi> with them: <pb n="255" facs="tcp:102964:140"/>And the
<hi>Athenians</hi> ſet their own Ships on Fire, in Number 200, and returned
Home with Diſgrace, when they had been Six Years in <hi>Egypt.</hi> After
this, a <hi>Peace</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between the <hi>Perſians</hi> and
thoſe of <hi>Greece.</hi> And in the Firſt Year of the 84th.
<hi>Olympiad,</hi> which ſoon followed, there was an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Peace</hi> throughout the <hi>World,</hi> which continued till the Firſt Year
of the 87th. <hi>Olympiad,</hi> at what time began the <hi>Peloponneſian</hi>
War.</p>
               <p>In the 4th. Year of the 88th. <hi>Olympiad, Artaxerxes</hi>
dyed, and his Son <hi>Xerxes</hi> was Inveſted with the Crown. But at a Years
End, being overcome with Wine, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling aſleep in a Place where no
<hi>Guard</hi> was kept, his Brother <hi>Secundianus,</hi> with the Help of an
<hi>Eunuch,</hi> murdered him, and took the <hi>Government</hi> on himſelf.
He alſo, was ſoon after diſpatched by his Brother <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>
               </p>

the End of the <hi>Peloponneſian War,</hi> with ſuch other Paſſages, as
would be too tedious for a Letter.</p>
               <p>I will only rehearſe a Memorable Saying of <hi>Darius,</hi> on
his Death-Bed, to his Eldeſt Son <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> who was to ſucceed
him in the <hi>Throne.</hi> The Prince being aſſured by the <hi>Royal
Phyſicians,</hi> That his Father's End drew near, thus addreſſed
<hi>Darius:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"My Father, ſince it is the Will of the
<hi>Gods</hi> to take you from Earth into their own Bleſſed Society, and
that you have been pleaſed, with the Conſent of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare me your <hi>Succeſſor</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> tell me, I
beſeech you, by what Methods of Policy you have Govern'd this <hi>Empire</hi>
theſe Nineteen Years, that ſo I may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your Example."</q> 'To whom the
<hi>King</hi> Reply'd; 
<q rend="inline">"My Son, be aſſured, That if my
<hi>Reign</hi> has been bleſſed with greater <hi>Succeſs</hi> and
<hi>Peace</hi> than thoſe of my <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors,</hi> 'tis becauſe in
all Things I have Honoured the <hi>Immortal Gods,</hi> and done Juſtice to
every Man."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was poſſeſſed of the
<hi>Crown,</hi> he ſent for his Brother <hi>Cyrus;</hi> and put him in
Manacles of Gold, with Deſign to make him privately away; but at the
Interceſſion of his Mother, he releaſed <pb n="257" facs="tcp:102964:141"/>him again,
and reſtor'd him to his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time, <hi>Plato</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very Young, gave an early <hi>Specimen</hi> of a ripe Wit, in Comforting
<hi>Antimachus</hi> the <hi>Poet,</hi> who loſt the <hi>Garland</hi> in a
Conteſt with <hi>Niceratus,</hi> at the <hi>Lyſandrian Feaſt.</hi> For
when he beheld the <hi>Poet</hi> extremely vex'd at the Ignorance and
Partiality of <hi>Lyſander,</hi> who knew not how to diſtinguiſh between
his lofty Meaſures, and the flat Rhimes of his Antagoniſt, <hi>Plato</hi>
bid him be of good Courage: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>his Ignorance no more
diminiſhes thy Knowledge, than a Blind Man's miſtaking thee for another,
would deprive thee of thy Sight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Cyrus</hi> was returned to his <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> he
plotted to depoſe his Brother: And to win <hi>Lyſander</hi> to his Party,
he preſented him with a Ship built all of Gold and Ivory.
<hi>Alcibiades,</hi> the Famous <hi>Athenian Captain</hi> perceiving this,
deſigned to give <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> notice of his Brother's
<hi>Treaſon;</hi> but by the Way he was murdered himſelf by ſome
Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers hired for that Purpoſe by <hi>Lyſander,</hi> who yet durſt not
ſet upon him in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, when he was armed in his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but in
the Night ſet his Houſe on Fire; and as he was eſcaping through the
Flames and Smoak, they lying in Ambuſh, ſhot him dead with Arrows.</p>
               <p>However, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> quickly became ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his
Brothers Deſigns; and raiſing <pb n="258" facs="tcp:102964:142"/>an Army of Nine hundred
thouſand Men, gave him Battel not far from <hi>Babylon.</hi> In the Fight he
was wounded by <hi>Cyrus;</hi> but after a hot Diſpute, <hi>Cyrus</hi> was
killed, and <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> got the Victory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pariſatis,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
the Death of her Son, cauſed thoſe that wounded him, to be killed with
lingring Torment: And inviting <hi>Queen Statyra,</hi> the Wife of
<hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> to a <hi>Feaſt,</hi> ſhe divided the Bird
<hi>Rhindaces</hi> aſunder with a Knife poiſoned on one ſide, and gave
the Enveno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Part to <hi>Statyra,</hi> eating the other her ſelf. Upon
which, the <hi>Queen</hi> died in horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Anguiſh and Torture.</p>
               <p>The famous Deeds of many <hi>Heroes,</hi> are alſo Recorded,
during the <hi>Reign</hi> of this <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes;</hi> as of <hi>Ageſilaus,

and <hi>Tizibazus, Perſians;</hi> with <hi>Conon</hi> the <hi>Athenian.</hi>
But fearing to entrench on thy Patience, I content my ſelf with only
mentioning their Names, and ſo finiſh my Letter with the Concluſion of
<hi>Artaxerxes</hi> his Life, who died of Grief for the Death of his Son
<hi>Arſames,</hi> whom <hi>Ochus</hi> his Brother had cauſed to be Murdered
out of Envy and Jealouſie, becauſe his Father do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on him.</p>
               <p>If I have not anſwered thy Expectation in this Letter, blame
not me, but the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> from whom I have collected theſe

               <p>I Know not well, whether it is my Part to be ſorry or glad,
when I hear thy Son is Wild and Prodigal: That he is Amorous, and very much

               <p>I proteſt, it ſeems difficult in my Opinion, to determine

Phrenſie of the Soul, a Divine Madneſs, elevating a Man up to the Pitch of
a <hi>Santone,</hi> and rendring him the Care of the Benigner <hi>Daemons.</hi>
He is every where ſafe; having the Favour of <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Men,</hi>
as the <hi>Roman Poet</hi> expreſſes it: 
<q> 
                     <l>Quiſquis Amore tenetur, eat tutuſque ſacerque.</l>
                  </q>
And had it not been for thy own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of this <hi>Noble Paſſion,</hi>
thou hadſt not had a Son to complain of.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it makes him expenſive and coſtly in his manner of
living. He wou'd, no doubt, appear Gay and Polite in the Eyes of his
<hi>Miſtreſſes:</hi> He would be Generous and Magnificent in his
Entertainments; Liberal to his Friends and Acquaintance; Charitable to all
Perſons in Diſtreſs. And canſt thou really blame him for putting in
Practice ſo many Amiable Vertues? Is not this better than to ſee him of a
ſneaking, ſordid Temper, addicted to Avarice, and other <hi>Ignoble</hi>
Vices? Remember thy own <hi>Genius,</hi> when thou wert Young; what a
paſſionate Delight thou took'ſt in <hi>Travelling?</hi> Yet, this cou'd
not be maintain'd without great Charges. Conſider therefore, that it is thy
own Blood, running in the Veins of thy <hi>Son,</hi> which prompts him to a
Noble Way of living. And do not thou imitate thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who by their
Severity, teach their Children to degenerate, inſtead of making 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102964:145"/>them better, or more reform'd. They frighten them from
the Paths of innate Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for the Lucre of their Gold, and take Abundance of
Pains to inſtruct them in the Methods of Covetouſneſs; as if that alone
were the <hi>Zenith</hi> of Wiſdom and Vertue, whereas it is in Truth, the
very <hi>Sink</hi> and <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary</hi> of all Vice.</p>
               <p>I will relate to thee a Story which I have heard in
<hi>Paris,</hi> which has ſomething in it very Singular and Remarkable,
concerning the Affection and Care of a Father toward his <hi>Extravagant</hi>
and <hi>Prodigal Son.</hi> This old Gentleman had a fair Seat about ten Leagues
from this City, which had belong'd to his Family for the ſpace of Five
Hundred Years. His Yearly Revenue was very conſiderable; and having only one
<hi>Son,</hi> he gave him the Liberty of managing Half his Eſtate, when he
came to the Age of One and Twenty Years.</p>
               <p>This young Spark being of a High Spirit, was ſo far from
harbouring any Thoughts of Frugality, that he cou'd hardly brook the
Neceſſity of living within the Compaſs of his Allowance. He addicted
himſelf to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, Drinking,</hi> and other lewd Courſes, which in a
ſhort Time conſum'd his Means, and reduc'd him to great Streights.</p>
               <p>About the ſame Time his Father dyed, and left him the
Remainder of his Eſtate, giving him all the Inſtructions that are uſual
in ſuch Caſes; and among the Reſt of his Sage Counſels, he charg'd him,
If it ſhou'd be <pb n="265" facs="tcp:102964:145"/>his Misfortune to become a
<hi>Bankrupt</hi> again, ſo as to be forc'd to ſell his Eſtate, that he
wou'd at leaſt not part with that Houſe which had been ſo long in the
Poſſeſſion of their Family: Eſpecially he conjur'd him to reſerve
one particular Chamber for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as long as he liv'd, which was the ſame
where he then lay a-dying. <hi>For this,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>will be a
Sanctuary for you, when you have no other Place of Refuge in the
World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Old Man's Deceaſe, his Son fell to his former
Courſe of Life; and, to make ſhort of it, in a few Years ſpent all his
Patrimony; even that very Houſe it ſelf, which he was forc'd to ſell at
laſt for an under-price, to ſupply his preſent Neceſſities. However,
he obey'd his Father's laſt Injunction; and in the Sale of the Houſe, made
<hi>Articles</hi> for the perpetual Claim and Uſe of that <hi>Chamber</hi> to
himſelf.</p>
               <p>It was not long before he had conſum'd the Money which he
receiv'd for the Houſe: So that now his laſt Support was gone. He try'd to
borrow ſome of his Friends and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance: And in Charity they ſupply'd
him at firſt with ſmall Sums: But when he often preſs'd them, they grew
weary of him, and deny'd to part with any more.</p>
               <p>The diſconſolate Gentleman, over-whelm'd with Grief and
Melancholy, returns to his <hi>Chamber,</hi> hoping to find ſome Eaſe in
that private Receſs; where he might at leaſt <pb n="266" facs="tcp:102964:146"/>have the
Privilege of venting his Sorrow in Sighs and Tears.</p>
               <p>He paſs'd away ſome time in this dejected Condition, when at
length he caſt his Eyes on an old <hi>Trunk</hi> which ſtood in a corner of
the Chamber, and which he had ſcarce ever regarded before. An odd Curioſity
promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to riſe and look into this Trunk, perhaps not ſo much in
Hopes of finding any Relief there, as to divert himſelf and paſs away the
tedious Minutes. <hi>And yet 'tis Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural for People in great Calamities and
Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, to flatter themſelves with the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of unexpected
Reliefs, and to catch at every the leaſt Glimpſe or Shadow, that ſeems to
preſage any Good.</hi> Be it how it will, he fell to rifling the
<hi>Trunk,</hi> but found nothing, ſave a Parcel of Old Rags and Papers, with
other Remnants and Fragments of Silk, Linnen, and Velvet, the Reliques and
Spoils of his Father's Wardrobe. This was no Booty for him: However, he ceas'd
not his Scrutiny, till he had quite empty'd the <hi>Trunk.</hi> When to his no
ſmall Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he found theſe Words on the Bottom: <hi>Ah
Prodigal! haſt thou ſpent All, and ſold thy Houſe? Now go and hang thy
ſelf. There is a Rope ready provided for thee in the Beam of the
Chamber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Young Gentleman looking up to the Cieling, and ſeeing a
Halter hang there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſten'd to an Iron Ring, was ſtruck with ſuch
a Damp, that concluding it was the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> that he
ſhould fulfill the <pb n="267" facs="tcp:102964:146"/>Words he found on the Bottom of the
<hi>Trunk;</hi> he immediately took a Chair, or Stool, and placing it juſt
under the Rope, got up and rais'd himſelf upon it, that ſo he might the
better reach the deſign'd Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Death.</p>
               <p>He ſtood not long muſing: For Life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd now
Inſupportable to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore putting the Halter about his Neck, in the
Height of Deſpair, he kick'd the Stool away. When behold, inſtead of
hanging there, he fell to the Ground, the weighty Swing of his Body having
pull'd out a Piece of ſquare Timber from the Beam, being that Part to which
the Ring was faſten'd. Immediately he was like to be over-whelm'd, and buryed
alive in a great Heap of Gold, which came ſhowring down upon him out of the
Hollow Place, which his Father had contriv'd on Purpoſe in the Beam, to put
this Kind <hi>Sarcaſm</hi> on his Son, now ſufficiently mortified by ſo
many Sorrows.</p>
               <p>In a word, this made ſo deep an Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on him, that
he grew reform'd, buying all his Eſtate back again with Part of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and employing the Reſt in Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, grew to be a Richer Man than his
Father, or any of his <hi>Progenitors.</hi>

<hi>Deſperado.</hi> This Perſon was one of that <hi>Sect</hi> they call
<hi>Huguenots,</hi> of whom there are great Multitudes in <hi>France;</hi> and
they are Diametrically Oppoſite to thoſe of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Faith</hi> in
their Principles, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Worſhipping <hi>God;</hi> yet are
tolerated by the <hi>State,</hi> to prevent the Inconveniencies of a <hi>Civil
War,</hi> and the Effuſion of Humane Blood. The King chuſing rather by
Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to win them to his Party, than by a ſevere Execution of the Laws in
Force <pb n="269" facs="tcp:102964:147"/>againſt them, to compell their Conſciences in
Matters relating to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet many Men are of Opinion, That this <hi>Royal</hi>
Condeſcention will not have its deſir'd Effect, upon a Stubborn and
Ungrateful ſort of People; who inſtead of being oblig'd to Fidelity and
Obedience by ſuch Indulgent Favours, are apt to interpret them as Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
of the <hi>King</hi>'s Impotence and Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to puniſh thoſe that
reſiſt his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to harden themſelves the more in their
Factious Inſolence: As it will appear by what I am going to relate of a
certain Religious <hi>Furioſo,</hi> a <hi>Huguenot</hi> by Profeſſion.
This Fellow coming one Day into the Great <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi>
which they call <hi>Noſtre Dame,</hi> makes up directly toward the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> who was celebrating the <hi>Maſs;</hi> and waiting a
convenient Seaſon to execute his Purpoſe, juſt as the <hi>Prieſt</hi>
was elevating that which they eſteem the <hi>Sacramental Body</hi> of
<hi>Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> above his Head, according to
Cuſtom, that it might be Ador'd by all the Congregation; this Ruffian ſteps
to him, and ſtriking the Wafer out of his Hand, trampl'd it under Foot, and
then aſſaſſinated the <hi>Prieſt</hi> with his Dagger.</p>
               <p>The whole Aſſembly were aſtoniſh'd at ſuch an
unexampl'd Attempt. They ſtood ſtill like Statues for a while, and
ſuffer'd the Villain to paſs through the Throng, till he came to the very
Gate of the <hi>Temple:</hi> When beginning to rouze out of their
Stupefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſome run after him, and ſo he was ſiez'd, 
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:102964:148"/>and carried before the next <hi>Cadi,</hi> or <hi>Judge
of Criminal Cauſes,</hi> who condemn'd him to have his Right Hand firſt cut
off before the Gate of the ſame Temple, where he had been guilty of this
Aſſaſſine and Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Body preſently afterwards to be
burnt alive. Which was accordingly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
               <p>But not thinking this a ſufficient Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
Diſhonour done to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi>
commanded Publick Prayers to be made which they call the <hi>Orai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
of Forty Hours. He appointed alſo a Solemn Proceſſion of all the
<hi>Clergy</hi> to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Noſtre Dame,</hi> to cleanſe
it from the Defilement (which, according to their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief) it had contracted by
this Impious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Soveraign Companies of the City likewiſe, attended
theſe Ceremonies in their Robes of Honour, to teſtifie their Devotion.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt not conclude me an <hi>Infidel,</hi> or ſay that I
undertake the Patronage of the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> if I condemn this
Fellow as a <hi>Martyr</hi> to his own Preſumption and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance. The
<hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Huguenots</hi> are all alike to me, ſo long as they
are equally Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But it is
not decent or wiſe, neither Good Manners nor Policy to affront the
Eſtabliſh'd <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> of the Country where a Man lives. 'Twas
ſufficient that this Ruffian, and all his Brethren, had the Liberty of
ſerving <hi>God</hi> after their own Way. It was an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble 
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102964:148"/>Immorality to diſturb the lawful <hi>Prieſts</hi> of
the Nation, eſpecially in ſo barbarous a Manner, in the very Heighth of
their Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the midſt of their Daily Sacrifice at the <hi>Altar</hi>
of their <hi>God;</hi> where they profeſs to immolate after a tranſcendant
Manner, no leſs than the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of the
<hi>Meſſias,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, all <hi>Nations</hi> are Zealous for their
<hi>Religion,</hi> and we <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> ſhou'd not ſcruple to put
to Death a Head-ſtrong <hi>Giafer,</hi> who wou'd preſume but to pollute
our Sacred <hi>Moſques</hi> by his Uncircumciſed Preſence; much leſs
ſhould we ſpare him, if he attempted to offer any Violence to a <hi>True
Believer,</hi> as he was Adoring the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> after the way
obſerved by our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and commanded by the <hi>Prophet.</hi> And
tho' theſe <hi>Nazarenes</hi> are Worſhippers of <hi>Images</hi> and
<hi>Pictures;</hi> tho' they Adore that, which to all outward Appearance is but
a <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Bread;</hi> yet the Precept of <hi>Moſes</hi> ought
to be regarded, which ſays, <hi>Ye ſhall not Blaſpheme the</hi> Gods
<hi>of the</hi> Nations <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye go to dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venerable Succeſſor</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the

by any Rude, Unſeemly, or Violent Carriage againſt them.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THere are a ſort of Men among the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene
Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> whom they call <hi>Caſuiſts.</hi> Theſe are
profoundly Vers'd in the Learning of the <hi>Schools,</hi> which (if thou
remembreſt) Honeſt Father <hi>Antonio,</hi> the Old <hi>Sicilian
Prieſt,</hi> our Friend, us'd to term <hi>The Science of Husks.</hi> A dry,
chaffy Sort of Knowledge, conſiſting only of empty, vapid Notions, windy
<hi>Idea's,</hi> Diſtinctions made in Sand, which may be effac'd, alter'd, or
form'd at Pleaſure. The very Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of theſe Metaphyſical
Trifles, is enough to put one in a Fever; ſo ſubtle is the Poyſon they
contain: a ſpiritual Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, which darts like Lightning through ones
Thoughts, and ſoon ferments the <hi>Soul,</hi> boiling our Reaſon up, to
Scum and Froth it ſelf away in Divine Jargon, and <hi>Religious</hi>
Nonſence.</p>
               <p>Theſe Men will ſpilt a Hair in Divinity, to make a Scruple,
or to diſannull it. They raiſe a Duſt in the Eyes of thoſe that give
Heed to them, and play faſt and looſe with Humane Reaſon, as it ſerves
a Turn. They'll make a Hog of a Cuſhion, and turn an Elephant into a
Coffee-Diſh, with their enchanting <hi>Haecceities, Identities,
Quatenus's,</hi> 
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:102964:149"/>and the Reſt of their Learned
<hi>Legerdemain,</hi> the perfect <hi>Hocus-Pocus</hi> of the
<hi>Sorbonne,</hi> by which they juggle Men out of their Senſes, and frame
<hi>Chimaera's</hi> far more Monſtrous than thoſe in the Fictions of
<hi>Ovid,</hi> or the more Early and Myſterious <hi>Poems</hi> of
<hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeus, Orpheus,</hi> and <hi>Heſiod.</hi> They teach Men to
ſtumble at a Feather in the way of a Religious Life, yet not to boggle at a
Milſtone or a Mountain, where Intereſt calls for Reſolution and Speed.
They ſtart more Difficulties than themſelves can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the Caſes
of the Poor: But where Plenty of Gold appears, every Thing is made eaſie and
plain. Mere Higglers in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; Quacks and Empiricks in Matters of
Conſcience; murdering a Thouſand Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Souls, for one they Cure:
Pretending to be Guides to <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> they lead Men through uncouth
Paths, and intricate wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, till they are loſt in Labyrinths of Error,
bordering on the Confines of Hell. And then they leave 'em to themſelves;
where, if they make One falſe Step, they go out of their Bounds, treſpaſs
on the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Frontiers, and ſo are either in Danger of a
Precipice, or at leaſt of being taken Captives, by the out-lying Scouts of
the <hi>Infernal Kingdom,</hi> from whom 'tis dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to eſcape.</p>
               <p>There were ſuch as theſe alſo among the <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> of Old, and ſo there are at this Day, in all Religions, Men
who are ſevere in <hi>Punctilio's,</hi> and neglect the <pb n="274" facs="tcp:102964:150"/>more Important <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>Law.</hi> Nor can the
<hi>Muſſulmans</hi> themſelves be free from this Embaraſsment of the
Faith and Truth brought down from Heaven.</p>
               <p>If thou obſerveſt the grave and ſupercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Looks of our
<hi>Imaum's, Mollah's, Cadi's,</hi> &amp;c. Thou'lt take 'em for the
Juſteſt Men, the Holyeſt Saints on Earth. Mark but their Diſcourſe,
'tis an Abridgement of the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran.</hi> They're ſeen each Morning at
the Firſt Hour of <hi>Publick Prayer,</hi> walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
<hi>Moſques,</hi> or ſitting in the Royal <hi>Coemeteries,</hi> under
ſome Melancholy Cypreſs, reading the Book of <hi>Aſſonah,</hi> or
ſome other Spiritual Treatiſe. With Eyes caſt up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or
humbly fix'd upon the Ground, and Minick Poſtures of their Hands, they act
Devotion to the Life: Yet, in their Hearts, perhaps, are ſtudying how to
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent their Neighbour.</p>
               <p>Go to theſe Perſons for Inſtruction in any doubtful
Caſe: They'll hamper thee with far-fetch'd Terms and crabbed Problems: With
formal Aſpects, and tedious Circumlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, ſtroaking their Beards, and
ſighing from Deceitful Breaſts, they'll Induſtriouſly amuſe thy Soul
with Dark <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> and trapan thy Senſe in Snares of
Inſignificant and Untelligible Words; ſtriving to make thee believe, they
are the <hi>Pick-Locks</hi> of the <hi>Eternal Cabinet,</hi> if not the
<hi>Privy-Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> of <hi>Heaven:</hi> Whereas, the way of Piety is
plain, and circumſcrib'd with certain noted Boundaries. 'Tis hard indeed for
a bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <pb n="275" facs="tcp:102964:150"/>Traveller, to find the Narrow Gate and
Firſt Avenue of this Sacred Path, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſo many Gorgeous, Glittering
Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, ever ſtanding open, and inviting Men into the ſpacious Fields of
Vice. But when he has once enter'd the obſcurer Paſs, he has nothing elſe
to do, but go directly on, without turning to the Right Hand or the Left; only
regarding the fix'd Landmarks of Eternal Truth, invariable Reaſon, and
ſound Morality. To ſpeak plainly, A Man's Duty is comprehended in a few
eaſie Rules: And he that goes to render 'em difficult, by knotty, thorny
Gloſſes, throws Stumbling-Blocks before the Feet of <hi>True
Believers,</hi> and interrupts their Pilgrimage to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>My Friend, if any Pious Scruples trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thee or me, let us
henceforth be our own <hi>Caſuiſts;</hi> and not by blind implicite Faith,
enſlave our <hi>Souls</hi> to Men perhaps more Ignorant than our Selves. The
<hi>Law</hi> is plain and poſitive, in neceſſary Matters. What need we
ſeek to entangle our Selves with more?</p>
               <p>If we perform our <hi>Oraiſons</hi> at the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hours,
What matter is it whether we obſerve the Six <hi>Traditionary</hi>
Poſtures, or no? VVe that are Illuminated, I only ſpeak of ſuch. As for
the Phlegmatick, Dull Multitude, 'tis fit they ſhou'd be curb'd with
Diſcipline, and made to obſerve the nice <hi>Punctilio's</hi> of Obedience.
VVhat ſignifies the old Verſatile Turn of th' Head, <pb n="276" facs="tcp:102964:151"/>from one ſide to th' other, as if we thought to catch the
<hi>Prophet</hi> peeping o'er our Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Or, VVhere's the Senſe of the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founder Myſtery, of poring on our Fingers with extended Palms, as if we
were at <hi>School,</hi> and learning our <hi>Alphabet;</hi> or imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the
clowniſh Ruſticks of <hi>Armenia,</hi> who as they work i'th' Fields and
Vineyards, will make a Dyal of their Hand, a <hi>Gnomon</hi> of a Straw, and
loſe an Hour in ſtedfaſt gazing on their dirty Fiſts, to know what Time
of Day 'tis? Then the Myſterious Reſting of our Hands upon our Knees, with
other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Ceremonies; VVhat are they all, but an External Diſcipline,
confirm'd by Ancient Cuſtom, and obſerv'd for Order's Sake? This need not
trouble thee or me, when e'er we have Occaſion to retrench ſuch
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Niceties.</p>
               <p>Nay, to go farther; if we ſhould neglect the ſtated Periods
of Solemn Adoration, compell'd thereto by Sickneſs, Travelling, or any other
Neceſſity; Be not diſconſolate, as if thou hadſt been guilty of a
Mortal Sin. Some ſupererogating VVork of Charity, will cancell Ten ſuch
Faults as that: Or at leaſt, thou may'ſt look boldly in the Face of
<hi>God,</hi> when at another Seaſon, on thy Knees, thou makeſt ample
Compenſation; Or by ſacred Abſtinence and Faſting, diſperſeſt all
the Miſts and Clouds of Guilt, that ſate ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy on thy Soul. The Times
are all alike to him who is <hi>Eternal.</hi> There's no Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Day
or Night, with that Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <pb n="277" facs="tcp:102964:151"/>Eſſence, who made the
Sun and Stars, and is himſelf th' unchangeable Source of Light.</p>
               <p>So, if we ſhou'd addreſs our Selves to <hi>Heaven,</hi>
without the uſual Forms of Prayer, or any words at all; we have no Reaſon
to be ſad, as if our <hi>Oraiſons</hi> were Ineffectual and Unheard. In the
Eternal High Receſs, our ſilent Vows and ſofteſt VVhiſpers of the
Soul, Eccho as loud as the moſt bold and noiſy Clamour of the Tongue. There
is a Rank of <hi>Spirits</hi> among the Reſt Above, on purpoſe made to waft
the Secret Thoughts of Mortal Men to <hi>Heaven.</hi> We cannot fail of
Audience there, when e'er we ſend the leaſt Ejaculation up, with firm
<hi>Credentials,</hi> from the Heart.</p>
               <p>In a word, believe my <hi>Dgnet,</hi> That the <hi>Supremely
Intelligent</hi> and <hi>Wiſe,</hi> chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Intention and
Fervour of our Minds, the Habitual Bent of our Souls, with the Innocent and
Pious Actions of our Lives. He is not to be mov'd (unleſs to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation) by
the vain Tautologies of our Verbal <hi>Oraiſons,</hi> the nauſeating
<hi>Crambe</hi> of devouteſt Words, common to Hypocrites and Perſons of
Sincerity, to the moſt Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible Sinners, and the Greateſt
<hi>Saints.</hi> The humble Silence of a Heart reſign'd to Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, is a
Pacifick Sacrifice, attoning for the greateſt Sins, attracting choiceſt
Favours, Smiles and Benedictions from the <hi>Eternal.</hi> This is the
Diſcipline of Sacred Love; the Rule of perfect Life, the Secret Chart of the 
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:102964:152"/>Elect, whereby they ſteer their Courſe to
<hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which of the <hi>Prophets</hi> was a formal <hi>Beadſman,</hi>
to number out his <hi>Oraiſons</hi> at Finger's End, and offer up to
<hi>God</hi> a ſhort and vain Retail of Words, in Recompence of Infinite
Bounties Paſt, and in Hopes of more to Come?</p>
               <p>VVhen <hi>Mahomet</hi> was purſu'd by cruel
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> and forc'd to make the VVilderneſs his Sanctuary, and
hide himſelf within the Hollow of an Aged Oak, He did not ſeek to amuſe
th' <hi>Eternal</hi> with ſtudied Forms of Speech and Humane Eloquence, or
tire th' Immortal Ears with a Religious long Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue; as if he thought to
enſnare the General Mercy of the <hi>Holy One,</hi> in Trains of Artificial
and Elaborate Language, or catch his more particular Indulgence, in a Trap of
Subtile Rhetorick. The harmleſs <hi>Saint,</hi> with Heart and Face, compos'd

trill'd down his Cheeks, His Soul was pierc'd with Sacred Pity to his Enemies.
He ſigh'd, and wiſh'd, in ſhort, whatever Blameleſs Piety cou'd
ſuggeſt for him and them. <hi>Angels</hi> immediately carried the
Prophetick Vows to <hi>Heaven.</hi> His ſilent paſſionate Prayer was
heard. The Cruel Perſecutors, blinded with Impious Fury, ruſh'd into the

abroad and rode at large: One Traytor ſpurr'd his Horſe through 
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102964:152"/>thickeſt VVebs of low entangl'd Thorns and Underwoods,
greedy of the Royal and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick Prey; whilſt others took the open Paths,
hoping to overtake the <hi>Prophet</hi> on the Flight. They ſeem'd to ſwim
or fly, rather than ride, ſuch was the Swiftneſs of their Courſe. Fierce
was the Cry, re-eccho'd from the Hollows of the Rocks, and Valleys, <hi>[Mecca,
for the Head of Mahomet.]</hi> Some ſtumbled at the out-creeping Roots of
Trees, and broke a Leg or Arm, by a Precipitate Fall from off their Beaſts;
whilſt others had their Eyes ſtruck Blind by Interfering Twigs. One had his
Turbant rudely bruſh'd off, and Scalp ſeverely ſhav'd, by broken Stumps
of Boughs, and Rows of Knotty Branches, plac'd and bent down by <hi>Fate,</hi>
on Purpoſe to revenge th' <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Cauſe on ſuch a
Miſcreant as this. Another cou'd not curb his Horſe from jumping down into
a deep blind Quarrey, dugg i'th' midſt o'th' VVood, where the proud Heretick
daſh'd his Skull and Brains upon the Marble Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the Bottom. So
Senſible and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive are Inanimate Creatures, when a Good Man, a Saint, a
Friend of <hi>God</hi> is wrong'd. The very Stocks and Stones, and all the
<hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are touch'd with Sacred Sympathies at ſuch a Time. The
Frame of <hi>Nature</hi> feels ſtrange tender Paſſions, Fits, and Qualms
of Amorous Regard: And <hi>God</hi> himſelf, if I may ſo expreſs my
ſelf, is rowz'd as from a Trance, and ſnatching up the Weapons of his Power
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102964:153"/>and VVrath, runs like a Champion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Cauſe
of injur'd Innocence.</p>
               <p>But, I forget that I am writing a Letter, and therefore ought to
be Brief. Beſides, what I have ſaid, is ſufficient to convince thee, That
I have an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> far different from that which the
<hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> whether <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulmans</hi> or

               <p>If thou can'ſt not think as I do, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee not. Uſe
thy Native Freedom; but remember, That tho' Men's Reaſons and Opinions vary

themſelves, tho' a <hi>Republick</hi> pretending to greater and faſter
Union of Intereſts, than what can be found in any <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Yet this
<hi>Commonwealth</hi> was rent into Three ſeveral Parties: VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of One was
headed by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange;</hi> the Other by <hi>John

<hi>Chief</hi> of Note.</p>

                  </gap> trouble
thee with a Character of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange.</hi> He is already
known by Fame at the <hi>Sublime Port.</hi> As to <hi>John De-Wit,</hi> I can
give no other Account at preſent; but that he was a Perſon whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had rais'd to ſuch an Eminence in the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> as made him the
<hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Rival, and Competitor for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy.
Therefore he ſought to exclude him from all Employments and Offices of
Truſt, that he might eſtabliſh himſelf in his Place.</p>
               <p>The Third Party, whom we may call <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans,</hi> were of
Opinion, That it was not for the Honour of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> to
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any <hi>Head;</hi> judging that the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment or
Excluſion, the Riſe or Fall of the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>De Wit,</hi>
ought to be a Thing Indifferent to the <hi>States.</hi> In regard the
<hi>Commonwealth</hi> appear'd in their ſight ſufficiently to flouriſh,
under the Protection of her own Arms and Riches, without having any Need of
either the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or <hi>De

               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:102964:154"/>However, notwithſtanding theſe
Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> among themſelves; as ſoon as they

They all Unanimouſly choſe the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> as

conſerv'd their Liberties. On the other ſide, <hi>De Wit</hi> having
rendred himſelf Odious to the Vulgar, was by them torn in pieces: Such a
Deſtiny oft happening to thoſe who aſpire to raiſe themſelves by
Unlawful Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and who are Ambitious to be the <hi>Ringleaders</hi> of a
<hi>Faction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> call the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi>
a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> without an Army; In Regard, the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> being
as yet only upon the Defenſive, and their Towns wanting ſtrong Garriſons;
their Soldiers are all diſpos'd of this Way, ſo that there is little or no
Appearance of a Field-Army.</p>
               <p>This is Certain, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is the
moſt Gallant <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> he paſſes from
Divertiſements to the Toils of War; and from the Champaign returns to his
Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures again. Thus, 'tis difficult to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between his
Labours and Recreations; his Pleaſures and his Buſineſs. They ſeem to
be near of Kin, that he takes equal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in both</p>
               <p>'Twas but a little before the firſt Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of this War,
That he and his Queen <pb n="284" facs="tcp:102964:155"/>were revelling in the Gardens of
<hi>Chantilly,</hi> where a <hi>Royal</hi> Entertainment was prepar'd for them
by Night. The <hi>Court</hi> attended them thither; and there the
<hi>Roman</hi> Luxury was ſeen in Royal Miniature. As ſoon as the Gates
were open'd, there appear'd an Artificial Day; ſo light was the Place made
with Flambeau's and Lamps: Which being well plac'd among the Trees, with other
refin'd Illuminations, adorn'd with Chaplets of Flowers, which preſented the
Eye with a pleaſing Medly of Colours, interſpers'd with Oranges, Citrons,
and other agreeable Fruits, tranſported the Company with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
Delight. All together pretty well reſembl'd a Foreſt in a Chamber: For the
Walls not being far from the Place where the <hi>King</hi> ſate, were hung
with Arras, with a Multitude of Lights burning near the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: And there
was a Spring of Water in the Middle of the Garden, raiſing it ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a
wonderful Manner into the Form of a High Pyramid; and falling again into Three
Baſons of Marble ſucceſſively from one to the other, made a pleaſant
Spectacle to the Courtiers.</p>
               <p>Then a moſt Magnificent Collation was ſerv'd up with Vocal
and Inſtrumental Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ſo ſoft and fine, with a ſudden Dew cooling
the Air, which had a Smell like Sweet-Bryars, as render'd the Place a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Paradiſe.</hi> After which followed the <hi>King</hi>'s Supper, far
ſurpaſſing the other Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet in all Manner of Delicacy and
Polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <pb n="285" facs="tcp:102964:155"/>as well as the ſtupendious Abundance of
Diſhes. When Supper was ended, they were entertain'd with a Show of
ſomething Admirable and New in Fire-Works. But, tho' it be ſo to them, I
will not trouble thee with a Deſcription of it, ſince thou haſt ſeen
far Finer and more Coſtly at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or where-ever the
Great <hi>Sultan</hi> kept his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at the Time of a
<hi>Dunalma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the <hi>King</hi> went to ſee the New
Fortifications of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> which he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd not long before. And
in a little time, follow'd this <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>War</hi> againſt
<hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So things go in a Circle; from <hi>War</hi> to <hi>Peace;</hi>
from <hi>Peace</hi> to <hi>War</hi> again. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, thou wilt the better know
by what I have ſaid, how to comport thy ſelf, in Caſe of any Difference
between the <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> at the

to adjuſt all Difficulties in their Stated Periods.</p>

               <p>THou haſt born with a Thouſand Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies in my
Letters; and I know not, whether what I'm now going to write, will deſerve a
better Character. However, I feel a Spirit within me, checking my Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Mind,
in that I was not before ſenſible of my Error, but muſt make ſo late a
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation. It is impoſſible for me to reflect on the vain and trifling
Subjects I have all along entertain'd thee with, and not to bluſh at ſo
grand an Overſight; Since I then ſeem'd not ſo much as to regard thy
Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Practice in <hi>Medicines,</hi> which has exalted thee to the
Honour of being plac'd in the Front of thoſe who take Care of the <hi>Grand

ſuitable to thy more Interiour Knowledge, and that hidden VViſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which
deſervedly ranks thee among the moſt Perfect and Accompliſh'd
<hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Ancient Times, <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Phyſick</hi> were
counted <hi>Sciences</hi> of ſuch a near Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mutual Dependance,
that one cou'd not ſubſiſt without the other. By <hi>Phyſick</hi> they
meant the General <hi>Science</hi> of <pb n="287" facs="tcp:102964:156"/>
                  <hi>Nature,</hi>
otherwiſe termed <hi>Magick:</hi> VVhich comprehended under it the Knowledge
of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> the <hi>Elements,</hi> and every <hi>Being</hi> within
their vaſt Circumference; The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Sun, Moon,</hi> and
<hi>Stars,</hi> their various <hi>Aſpects, Influences,</hi> and

<hi>Metals, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,</hi> and other Subſtances found both on the Surface of
the Earth, within its Concave, and in the Sea.</p>
               <p>Such as theſe of Old, were <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> with
the <hi>Magi</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Chaldaea.</hi> Such was
<hi>Hierarchas</hi> among the <hi>Brachmans; Teſpion</hi> the

VVith many others of different Nations; as, <hi>Zenotenus, Kirannides, Almadal,
Thetel, Alchind, Abel, Ptolomy, Geber, Zahel, Nazabarub, Tebiti Aerith,
Salomon, Aſtrophon, Hipparchus, Alomeon,</hi> &amp;c. And of later Date,
<hi>Albertus,</hi> Surnam'd <hi>the Great, Arnol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus de Villa Nova, Cardan,
Raymund Lullius:</hi> VVith a few more, not worth the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>Theſe contemplated the Secret Force and Virtue of
<hi>Celeſtial</hi> and <hi>Sublunary</hi> Things; <pb n="288" facs="tcp:102964:157"/>the
hidden Sympathy between them, and the <hi>Myſterious Powers</hi> of Nature.
Then having by a curious and painful Scrutiny trac'd out the true
<hi>Genealogies</hi> of Things; caſt their <hi>Nativities;</hi> and
diſcover'd all their Kindred, Allies, Friends and Enemies; knew by applying
in due Seaſons, <hi>Actives</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Paſſives,</hi> how to
produce Effects ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſtupendious Prodigies to the Vulgar, and no leſs
than Miracles: VVhereas, all this is but a pure Reſult of Nature, help'd by
Humane Art. So VVatches, Dyals, Clocks, and Mirrours, appear'd at firſt to
th' Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant VVorld, the Effects of <hi>Magick:</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Simple
Natives of <hi>America,</hi> ſhew'd little more VVit than Apes or Cats, which
look behind the Glaſs, to find the Active Figure of themſelves, that they
ſaw in it.</p>
               <p>And now I'm got amongſt thoſe poor <hi>Barbarians,</hi> I
can't forget a Paſſage of a <hi>Peruvian</hi> Slave, who being ſent by
his <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Maſter with a Basket of choice Fruit and a Letter to
his Friend; The ſilly <hi>Ignoramus</hi> being faint, by Reaſon of the
exceſſive Heat; his Journey being alſo tedious, from the Town of
<hi>Lima</hi> to a Village near the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> eat up the
Fruit by the way, to allay his Hungry Thirſt. However, not having ſo good a
Stomach to the Letter, he deliver'd it ſafe to the Perſon to whom it was
addreſs'd; never once dreaming, that an Inſenſible Piece of Paper cou'd
tell Tales. But, that diſcovering his Crime when he came home, his Maſter
order'd him the <pb n="289" facs="tcp:102964:157"/>
                  <hi>Baſtinado,</hi> to make him
ſenſible of it. Then he was ſent again on the ſame Errand, with
<hi>Oranges</hi> and a Letter; and meeting with the ſame Temptation, he knew
not what to do. At laſt, he hid the Letter under a Heap of Sand; wiſely
concluding, That if it ſaw him not, it cou'd ne'er betray his Fact. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
to ſecure it from all Means of peeping, he ſpread his Mantle o'er the
Place, and then fell roundly to his Banquet; thinking he ſhou'd now have no
Accuſer. In fine, he eat up all the <hi>Oranges,</hi> and was worſe bang'd
for his Pains than the time before.</p>
               <p>Generous <hi>Hali,</hi> thou ſeeſt I'm fall'n into the
ſame Error for which I made Apology at the Beginning of this Letter: But,
thou canſt eaſily forgive ſuch Crimes as theſe. Suffer me only to
relapſe thus far, That I may mention the <hi>Mathematical Magicians;</hi>
ſuch as <hi>Archytas,</hi> who made a <hi>Wooden Pigeon</hi> to fly; and
<hi>Albert the Great,</hi> who taught a <hi>Brazen Head</hi> to ſpeak: not
forgetting him unknown by Name, who gave to the Statues of <hi>Mercury, Voluble
Tongues,</hi> and <hi>Elegant Language;</hi> by whoſe <hi>Mechanick</hi> Art,
a <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Serpent</hi> learnt to hiſs; and Birds of the ſame Metal,
with other Helps, outvy'd the Nightingales and Thruſhes in their Melody.</p>
               <p>I will not omit the Execrable Practices of
<hi>Necromancers,</hi> or ſuch as Invocate the Dead, and with nefandous
Ceremonies, Rites and Sacrifice, call to their Aid <hi>Infernal Spirits;</hi>
bind them in Cryſtals, or ſome other Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and then Adore them, as the
Ancient <pb n="290" facs="tcp:102964:158"/>
                  <hi>Romans</hi> did their <hi>Lares</hi> and
<hi>Penates.</hi> Theſe are their Oracles which they conſult in all
Emergencies; and by their Help, work Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the World, foretell Things
Future, and reveal the moſt remote and hidden Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, whether Paſt or
Preſent. Nor is this a Fable or an Old Wives Tale; for, unleſs the
experienc'd Nations of the Earth had found ſome real Evils, from Wizards,
Magicians and Witches; they wou'd not have made ſo ſevere Laws againſt
them, as to aim at their Extermination from the Earth.</p>
               <p>Neither need we admire; that Women are as much addicted to
theſe curſed Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as Men; ſince they are naturally more
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive into Secrets, and leſs cautious of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impos'd upon:
They're prone to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; and, from their Infancy, bred up to obſerve
their <hi>Dreams,</hi> their <hi>Moles,</hi> and other <hi>Marks</hi> upon
their Bodies. They covet all the Depth of <hi>Palmeſtry</hi> and
<hi>Phyſiognomy;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a thouſand other little Follies.</p>
               <p>If they meet a Man i'th' ſtreet at firſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, they
are encourag'd, and take it for a Sign of their good Fortune: but, if one of
their own Sex encounters them; they curſe the undeſigning Female, and
return home again. They obſerve <hi>Fatal Days,</hi> and <hi>Nights,</hi> and
certain <hi>Critical Hours,</hi> wherein they try Experiments to know their
Future Husbands. They brew Enchanting <hi>Philters</hi> for their Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and
Intoxicate them with Liquors, wherein young Human <hi>Cupids</hi> have been
boil'd, with Herbs as powerfull to effect <pb n="291" facs="tcp:102964:158"/>their Wiſh,
as thoſe that <hi>Circe</hi> or <hi>Medea</hi> knew. In ſhort, there is no
<hi>Species</hi> of <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilegy,</hi> or <hi>Divination,</hi> which vain
young Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens are not practis'd in. Which is a fair Diſpoſition, or
Introduction, to the <hi>Blackeſt</hi> kind of <hi>Magick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But bleſſed are they, O Pious and moſt learned
<hi>Hali,</hi> who being profoundly skill'd, and daily converſant in the
<hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> have never yet tainted themſelves by
any unlawfull Commerce with <hi>Spirits</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, Infernal, and Enemies to
<hi>God.</hi> They are Divine <hi>Magicians,</hi> having <hi>Celeſtial</hi>
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, the Hidden Name of <hi>God</hi> imprinted on their <hi>Souls;</hi>
whereby they are able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the <hi>Angels,</hi> and make the Higheſt

               </head>
               <p>IT has been a long time ſince the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have
openly publiſh'd Libels againſt our <hi>Holy Lawgiver,</hi> and the
<hi>Book</hi> which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Hands of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> one of the
Chief Princes of <hi>Heaven:</hi> They affirm for an undoubted Truth, That
<hi>Mahomet</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf compos'd that <hi>Volume</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> by
the Help of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian Monk,</hi> and
<hi>Abdalla</hi> a <hi>Jew:</hi> And that it is but an <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Medley,</hi> a <hi>Hotch-potch,</hi> or <hi>Gallimaufry</hi> of <hi>Pagan,
Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Principles; cunningly ſuited and
blended together, in order to gain <hi>Proſelytes</hi> of all Religions.</p>
               <p>I proteſt by the Veneration I owe to the <hi>Eternal God</hi>
of <hi>Heaven,</hi> That I really believe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be of
<hi>Divine</hi> Original. Such is the inimitable Elegance of the Style, the
Brightneſs and Force of its Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the wonderfull and
charming Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things <hi>Hiſtorical, Moral</hi> and
<hi>Divine;</hi> That all the Writings in the World beſide, ſeem to me flat

have never read any <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, that undertook to
refute theſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: Which makes me apt to think, there is none ſuch
extant. For, I have made dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Enquiry, diſcours'd with ſeveral
Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctors of our <hi>Law;</hi> but can gain no Satisfaction in that
Point.</p>
               <p>Perhaps, our Fathers in former Ages, were ignorant how the
<hi>Meſſenger of God</hi> had been traduc'd by the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi>
or if they knew it, yet they diſdain'd to anſwer ſuch Malicious Lyes. And
as for theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Times, the Zeal of Religion is grown too Cold among the
<hi>True Believers.</hi> Every one is carried away with Self-Love, whilſt no
Man will be at the Pains to defend the Truth, or manifeſt the Errors of our
Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Beſides, it is now impoſſible to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what they ſay
concerning <hi>Neſtorius</hi> and <hi>Abdalla;</hi> unleſs we cou'd produce
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of unqueſtionable Authority, who liv'd in <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Time,
and ſo could give a more exact Account of his Life, than thoſe that came
after them.</p>
               <p>However, if we conſult common Reaſon, we ſhall find it
very improbable, That Three Men of ſuch Contrary Principles, as a
<hi>Jew,</hi> a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Pagan,</hi> ſhould all
volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily agree and jump in one Deſign of brewing their ſeveral
<hi>Religions</hi> together, and drawing ſuch an Extract from them as could
ſuit with neither of their Parties ſingly, and was like to have all of them
together for its Enemies <pb n="294" facs="tcp:102964:160"/>and Perſecutors: There was no
Ground for them to expect the Converſion of any <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo long as
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> aſſerts <hi>Jeſus the Son of Mary</hi> to be <hi>the
True Meſſias, the Word and Breath of God, Worker of Miracles, Healer of
Diſeaſes, Preacher of Heavenly Doctrine;</hi> and <hi>Examplary Pattern of
a perfect Life;</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that he was <hi>Crucify'd,</hi> but affirming
that he <hi>Aſcended into Paradiſe.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Jews</hi> call him
an <hi>Execrable Impoſtor, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, Seducer</hi> of the <hi>Nations;</hi>
and finally, by way of extreme Deriſion, they term him <hi>the Man that was
hang'd on a Tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither was the <hi>Alcoran</hi> like to find any better
Entertainment among the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for this laſt Reaſon; In
that it denies the <hi>Crucifixion</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> which is

aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> nor to a great many
other Things which the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> Law enjoyns. Eſpecially, they
could never brook the Denial of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the ſame Reaſon, this ſuppos'd patch'd Form of
Religion would have been as little welcom to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in that it
took from them the Multitude of their <hi>Gods,</hi> and aſſerted the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the <hi>Divine Eſſence.</hi> So that all

has had ſuch Succeſs in the World, could not be forg'd by thoſe Three,
nor compos'd by any Humane <pb n="295" facs="tcp:102964:160"/>Pen; but is of Divine
Original. Beſides, had there been ſuch a Triumvirate known in the Caſe,
the <hi>Coraei's</hi> of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and other Mortal Enemies of
<hi>Mahomet</hi> and his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, would not have ſpar'd to upbraid him with
it: And if they were not known to the <hi>Arabians</hi> who were converſant
with him, how come the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be inform'd of this private
<hi>Cabal,</hi> who were altogether Strangers to <hi>Mahomet</hi> at that
Time?</p>
               <p>Conſider well theſe Things, and thou wilt have no Reaſon

               <head>LETTER VII. To <hi>Hamet, Reis Effendi, Principal
Secretary</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HEre has been hot Work this Summer in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> The
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> has made ſuch ſwift and large Conqueſts
on the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> that they have hardly had Time to conſider their
Loſſes, and the Number of their Towns fallen into their Enemies Hands.</p>
               <p>It always falls out ſo, when this <hi>Monarch.</hi> goes in
Perſon to the Campaign as he did this Year. In a very little Time he took
<hi>Burich, Orſoy, Rimberg, Vezel, Rees, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> and many other
Places. Yet this Succeſs was allay'd with the Death of the <hi>Duke</hi> of
<hi>Longueville,</hi> who fell a Victim, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Dullneſs or Temerity,
in not hearing or not receiving the Cries of the Enemy, who demanded Quarter as
the <hi>French</hi> were paſſing the <hi>Rhine.</hi> He was ſhot with a
Musket-Bullet: and the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Enguien,</hi> his Couſin, verry
narrowly eſcap'd; for they were both jointly engag'd in the ſame
Action.</p>
               <p>The Death of this <hi>Prince</hi> is much lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only by
thoſe of his <hi>Family,</hi> but by the whole <hi>Court</hi> and City, as
being the <pb n="297" facs="tcp:102964:161"/>Flower of his Time; having ſignaliz'd his
Valour at the Siege of <hi>Candie,</hi> the Conqueſt of the
<hi>Franche-Comptè,</hi> and other Warlike Expeditions. And they
diſcourſe, as if he had been deſign'd to ſtand <hi>Candidate</hi> for
the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Crown.</p>
               <p>I am the more particular in this Relation, becauſe the
Enterprize of the <hi>French King</hi> in paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> is
look'd upon as one of the moſt hardy and bold, that ever was taken in Hand.
In all the Hiſtories of theſe Parts, there is not one Example of ſo
ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing an Expedition. And the Succeſs anſwer'd their Expectations:
For the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> were extremely daunted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned by the
News of theſe Exploits. In a little Time <hi>Arnheim</hi> and
<hi>Nimeghen,</hi> were reduc'd to the <hi>King</hi>'s Obedience; with the Fort
of <hi>Skin,</hi> and Towns of <hi>D'Oesburg, Bomel, Zutphen; Deventer,</hi>
the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of a <hi>Province;</hi> with <hi>Weifet, Tongres,
Maſeick, Dortemein, Elbourgh, Woerden, Arnham,</hi> another <hi>Capital</hi>
City, with many more Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, too tedious to be rehears'd.</p>
               <p>In a Word, ſuch are his Expeditions, Marches, his Sage
Counſels, his Never-fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Succeſs, That the People think it no Flattery
to call him a Second <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great, Timurleng, Scanderbeg,
Scipio, Hannibal,</hi> and all the Great Heroick Names in the World.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak the Truth, the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> have
all along made an Illuſtrious Figure in the World. And their Famous Exploits
in <pb n="298" facs="tcp:102964:162"/>War, with their Heroick Actions in Time of Peace,
afford ſufficient Matter for the higheſt <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> without an
occaſion of <hi>Hyperbole's.</hi> Which made one of the <hi>Roman
Mufti</hi>'s, in a Letter to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> thus
expreſs himſelf: 
<q rend="inline">"By how much the <hi>Royal</hi> Dignity
tranſcends the State of other Men, ſo far is the <hi>Monarchy</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> exalted above all the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in the World."</q>
                  <hi>Pope <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> IV. ſaid, That the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was
as the <hi>Morning Star</hi> in the <hi>Firmament</hi> of <hi>Princes;</hi>
brighter than all other <hi>Kings,</hi> a perfect <hi>God</hi> on Earth. 'Tis
aſſerted by another Author, That by the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi>'s
Shadow, the whole VVorld is rul'd. And ſuch was the Eſteem which <hi>Pope
Clement</hi> had for this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that he granted a Hundred Days
Indulgence to every one that pray'd for the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France;</hi>
to which <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> IV. added Ten Days more.</p>
               <p>'Tis a <hi>Maxim</hi> in the <hi>Salick Law,</hi> That the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> never dies. But this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is altogether as
True in <hi>Spain, Great-Britain,</hi> and other <hi>Hereditary Kingdoms,</hi>
till the Succeſſion fails. For then it degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to an <hi>Elective
Monarchy,</hi> or otherwiſe into <hi>Ariſtocracy;</hi> or laſt of all
into <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy,</hi> or a <hi>Republick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>France</hi> is yet free from theſe painted Forms of
Slavery. Her <hi>Kings</hi> are Maſculine and Vigorous; her Queens Chaſt
and Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. There never wants an Heir apparent to the <hi>Crown.</hi> And
this ſecures the Nation <pb n="299" facs="tcp:102964:162"/>from a Thouſand Calamities,
which atten <hi>Elective Monarchies,</hi> and more Popular Forms of
Government.</p>
               <p>What Injuſtices, Cruelties, Maſſacres, and all manner of
Publick Grievances were complain'd of in <hi>Rome,</hi> after <hi>Claudius
Caeſar</hi> had bought the <hi>Empire</hi> of his Souldiers? VVhat
Bicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings between the <hi>Senate,</hi> the <hi>People,</hi> and the
<hi>Armies?</hi> Each Party would have an <hi>Emperor</hi> of their own
chuſing, one <hi>Province</hi> was Emulous of another: So that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
there have been Twenty or Thirty <hi>Emperors</hi> together, all claiming the
<hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty.</hi> And when there were but Two, ſuch was the Obſtinate
and Strong Diſpute between them, That they have been forc'd to ſhare the
<hi>Empire</hi> equally, as the only Means to prevent its utter
Diſſolution, Hence ſprung the Firſt Inſtitution of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues in the
<hi>Empire.</hi> And this was the Root of thoſe Factions and Diviſions,
which encreaſing and growing up with Time, branch'd forth into ſmaller
Schiſms; till at length, by the Ambition of ſome, the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune or
Careleſsneſs of others, or at leaſt their want of Power and Courage; that
Mighty <hi>Empire</hi> was Cantoniz'd, rent in Pieces, and dwindl'd into that
narrow Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which it now poſſeſſes under the <hi>Tutelage</hi> of
the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> And there appear no hopes of its
ever being reſtor'd again to its priſtine Grandeur, unleſs the
<hi>Bourbons,</hi> with their growing Fortune, ſhall Crown the <hi>Eagle</hi>
with a Chaplet of <hi>Flower-de-Lys's,</hi>

<hi>Vienna,</hi> to All-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a Word, <hi>Henry</hi> IV. began the Deſign; <hi>Lewis</hi>
XIII. carried it on; and this preſent King has ſo far improv'd it, by his
Match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fortune and Courage, that in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, this or the next
Age will ſee it brought to Perfection.</p>

               <p>THy Letters make me very reſtleſs and inquiſitive; They
awaken New Doubts and Scruples in my Breaſt, inſtead of remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or

the more thou laboureſt to faſten me in thy narrow Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and
bigotted Zeal for the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the
<hi>Roman Church,</hi> the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer I grow. My <hi>Soul</hi> is like a Wild

his Native Liberty, ſcampering at large through the ſolitary VVaſte; nor
can he be wheedl'd by Humane Craft, to loſe his beloved Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or change
it for a Tame Captivity.</p>
               <p>I have revolv'd in my Mind the Ages that are Paſt, and the
Years of Untraceable Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. I have examin'd the Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the
VVorld, recorded in Hiſtory; from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> from
<hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and from <hi>Jeſus</hi> to theſe
preſent Days where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live. After all, I find that the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi>
of Former Tranſactions are cover'd with great Darkneſs; yet there are not
want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Glimmerings of Light, to direct <pb n="302" facs="tcp:102964:164"/>a
diligent Mind, an Impartial Lover of Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> was of the
<hi>Stock</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi> He was
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in all
Things to a Tittle: And in his Life time he ſaid, <hi>Think not that I come
to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Law, but to perfect it.</hi> His <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
obſerv'd the ſame Rule, and in all Things were ſtrict Obſervers of the
<hi>Stated Precepts.</hi> So were the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> even to
the keeping of the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath;</hi> beſides the <hi>Firſt
Day</hi> of the <hi>Week,</hi> appointed for the <hi>Publick Celebration</hi>
of their own <hi>Myſteries.</hi> They abſtain'd from <hi>Blood,</hi> and
from <hi>Things ſtrangl'd,</hi> and from all <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean Meats,</hi> and
ſuch as were <hi>Sacrific'd</hi> to <hi>Idols.</hi> They had no
<hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Pictures</hi> in their <hi>Churches, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,</hi> or
<hi>Oratories.</hi> In fine, they obſerv'd all the Neceſſary
<hi>Purifications,</hi> and Ador'd <hi>One God</hi> with Unity of Heart, a
Lively Faith, and Good VVorks. VVhereas thou ſeeſt, the preſent <hi>Roman
Church</hi> follows quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Maxims.</hi> They give the Lye to our

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Liberty;</hi> That we may now as freely banquet on the <hi>Blood</hi> of

<hi>Libertines</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in the VVorld, when they find
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be a mere Heap of palpable Contradictions.</p>
               <p>To this thou wilt anſwer, according to the common Rule of
<hi>Divines,</hi> That during the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> the
<hi>Apoſtles</hi> and all other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> obſerv'd the
<hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for fear of giving Scandal to the
<hi>Jews,</hi> of whom great Numbers were converted to the <hi>Chriſtian
Faith,</hi> when they ſaw that the <hi>Followers</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> did
not deviate from the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> of the <hi>Seniors,</hi> the
<hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>Jacob:</hi> But that
afterwards, when the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was <hi>preach'd</hi> far and wide on
the Face of the Earth, and that many of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Nations were
brought over to the <hi>Church;</hi> it was no longer neceſſary, for the
ſake of ſo Contemptible a People as the <hi>Jews,</hi> to ſcandalize all
the Reſt of the World, and impoſe on them a Yoke which they were not
accuſtom'd to bear, and which wou'd tempt them to ſhake off
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf, rather than ſubmit to ſo Intolerable a
Burden: Therefore the <hi>Church,</hi> to facilitate as much as in her lay, the
<hi>Converſion</hi> of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> which then extended it
ſelf over the Greateſt Part of the Earth; accommodated her Injunctions,
Precepts, Manners, and Ceremonies of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> to the preſent
Humour and Mode of thoſe Times. And whereas the <hi>Gentiles</hi> eat 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:102964:165"/>of all Meats Indifferently; ſo they were taught, that
this was agreeable to the VVill of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> who came to
reſcue Men from the Slavery and Bondage of <hi>Moſaick
Superſtitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the very ſame Rule, they introduc'd the Uſe of
<hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Pictures</hi> in their <hi>Churches:</hi> And the
<hi>Veſtments</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the <hi>Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the
<hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Tapers, Lamps, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, Flower-Pots,</hi> and other
<hi>Religious</hi> Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties; were faſhion'd according to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns they
receiv'd from the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Apollo, Venus,
Diana,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Heathen Deities.</hi> Hence the
<hi>Feſtivals</hi> of the <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Goddeſſes,</hi> were
turn'd to <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> of <hi>Saints;</hi> and <hi>Temples</hi> before
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated to the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh
Dedicated to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Martyrs.</hi> Thus the very
<hi>Pantheon</hi> it ſelf in <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>All the
Gods,</hi> in Proceſs of <hi>Time,</hi> by an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi>
Dexterity, was Converted to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>All-Saints.</hi> In a
word, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in all Things ſeem'd no other than
<hi>Gentiliſm</hi> in Diſguiſe. And it muſt be thought a <hi>Pious
Fraud,</hi> thus to wheedle ſo many Millions of Sinners into the Boſom of
the <hi>Church,</hi> whether they wou'd or no.</p>
               <p>Oh! <hi>Father William,</hi> doſt thou not bluſh at theſe
Trivial Excuſes, for the manifeſt Violation of the <hi>Laws</hi> of
<hi>God?</hi> Can <hi>Man</hi> be wiſer than the <hi>Omnipotent?</hi> Or will
he preſume to correct the Ways of <hi>Him</hi> that is <hi>Perfect</hi> in
<hi>Knowledge?</hi> Is the <hi>True Religion</hi> to be propagated by imitating
the <hi>Idolatrous <pb n="305" facs="tcp:102964:165"/>Rites</hi> of <hi>Infidels?</hi> Or by
proſtituting the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Injunctions</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to the
<hi>Caprices</hi> of <hi>Humane Policy?</hi> Did ever any wiſe
<hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver</hi> condeſcend to alter and new-model his Laws, to humour a
peeviſh captious <hi>Subject?</hi> VVou'd he add or diminiſh any Thing for
the Sake of gaining a Faction or Party? And can we think, that <hi>God</hi>
ever deſign'd, or can be pleas'd to have his <hi>Divine Laws</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl'd
and mix'd with profane <hi>Indulgences, Diſpenſations</hi> and Amendments
of <hi>Mortals?</hi> As if he had been Ignorant what he did, when he divulg'd
his <hi>Statutes,</hi> and wanted the <hi>Counſel</hi> of his
<hi>Creatures</hi> to help him out at a dead Lift.</p>
               <p>Was that Tenderneſs to be only ſhew'd to the <hi>Jews</hi>
for a Time? And were they for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver afterwards to be ſcandaliz'd? In vain
do's the <hi>Church</hi> daily pray for the Converſion of that People,
whilſt by her Doctrines and daily Practices, ſhe hardens them more in their
Infidelity. The <hi>Ethiopian Church</hi> is a ſtanding Witneſs againſt
her to this Day, where the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> from all Antiquity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from
the Times of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> have kept that Part of the <hi>Law</hi>
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which relates to <hi>Cleanneſs</hi> and
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> and preſcribes the Choice we are to make of
<hi>Meats</hi> allow'd to be <hi>Eaten,</hi> forbidding thoſe that are
Execrable, and an Abomination. Hence it is, that there are more <hi>Jews</hi>
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the <hi>Chriſtian Belief</hi> in that Country, than in any
other Part of the World beſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:102964:166"/>It was, in my Opinion, to begin at the
wrong End, thus to neglect the <hi>Salvation</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> our

run to proſelyte the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by ſuch prepoſterous Methods, as
render'd us in a manner as much Their <hi>Converts,</hi> as them Ours: ſince

               <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> ſeem more
Excuſable than we: For, tho' they are not ſo punctual in obſerving all

<hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> abſtain from all Manner of <hi>Fleſh,</hi>
during the whole Courſe of their Lives. They obſerve alſo many
<hi>Purifications,</hi> and wholeſome Rules of Life. Whereas we of the

<hi>Catholicks,</hi> the <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in the <hi>High

               <p>There is a Rumour ſpread up and down, of the <hi>Wandring

<hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> after the Year 1700. That the
<hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all this to be perform'd by the
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Gifts of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, who ſhall reſtore Truth to its
Primitive Luſtre and Integrity. They ſay, He will cauſe the

<hi>Cleanneſs</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs,</hi> &amp;c. That in his Days,

               <p>I Have a Kinſman by <hi>Blood,</hi> reſiding at
<hi>Aſtracan,</hi> in the Parts of <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> His Name is
<hi>Iſouf,</hi> a Man of an ardent Spirit, and active Wit; a great Traveller,
and one who makes good that Character by the ſolid Remarks he has made on the
moſt Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Things in his Way through <hi>Aſia, Africk,</hi> and
<hi>Europe.</hi> For he is not in the Number of thoſe who come home from
Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, only laden with Vanities and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles.</p>
               <p>From him I receive frequent <hi>Diſpatches,</hi> ſince his
being ſetled at <hi>Aſtracan,</hi> in Quality of a <hi>Merchant;</hi> where
he improves his Eſtate to great Advantage, enjoys the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102964:167"/>Pleaſures of Human Life, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf
to be tainted with the Vices which are unprofitable, troubleſome, and bring
Scandal to a Man's Reputation. For ſome Vices, thou know'ſt, paſs into
the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament of Vertues, when Intereſt or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity give an
Indulgence.</p>
               <p>There is a mutual Intercourſe between my Couſin and me: And
among other Letters which he ſends me, I receiv'd one lately; wherein he
informs me, that he whom they call the <hi>Wandring Jew,</hi> of whom I made
mention formerly in one of my <hi>Diſpatches</hi> to the Sublime Port, is now
at <hi>Aſtracan;</hi> That he preaches openly in the <hi>Markets,</hi> and at
the <hi>Bourſe</hi> or <hi>Exchange;</hi> not refuſing private
Converſation with any that deſire it.</p>
               <p>There is a great Conflux of People from all Nations, and of all
Religions to that City. He carries himſelf with an equal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to
every various <hi>Sect,</hi> and they all ſeem mightily taken with his
Doctrines. The Chief Thing he aims at in all his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, is, That
there will e'er long be an Univerſal Change of <hi>Religion</hi> over all the
Earth; and that every Nation on the Globe ſhall worſhip <hi>One God,</hi>
obey the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi>
and embrace One <hi>Faith.</hi> When he inſiſts on this, he ſeems to be
void of all Doubts and Heſitations; ſpeaks Magiſterially, like a
<hi>Prophet,</hi> who has receiv'd a ſure and certain Revelation of the Thing
he foretells. But when any <pb n="310" facs="tcp:102964:168"/>Diſpute with him, not in a
Spirit of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, but to ſift the Truth; he freely condeſcends
to anſwer all their Objections with ſolid Reaſons, and to convince them
by their own Principles, that it muſt be ſo.</p>
               <p>He ſays, That about the Year 1700 of the <hi>Chriſtians
Hegira,</hi> the Invincible <hi>Oſmans</hi> ſhall break down the Fences of
<hi>Europe,</hi> and ſhall overflow all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> like a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Torrent, that has over-top'd its Banks. In thoſe Days there ſhall be great
Deſolation in <hi>Hungary, Poland, Germany, France,</hi> and other Regions of
the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Only <hi>Denmark, Sweden, Muſcovy,</hi> and other
Countries of the <hi>North</hi> ſhall remain untouch'd. But above all other
Nations, he ſays, <hi>Italy</hi> will be made a perfect Wilderneſs, her
Cities laid in Aſhes, her Immenſe Wealth plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd and carried away by the
greedy <hi>Tartars, Arabians</hi> and <hi>Turks;</hi> who will ſpare neither
Age nor Sex, putting all to the Sword, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the
<hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> none of which ſhall eſcape the Publick
Vengeance, ſave Three <hi>Cardinals,</hi> ſincere and Holy Perſons, who
ſhall fly into <hi>England</hi> for Sanctuary by the way of the Sea.</p>
               <p>That Iſland, he ſays, ſhall become the Refuge of all
ſuch who can eſcape the Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities involving the adjacent Countries.
Thither they ſhall flock with their Wives and Children and all their Wealth,
when they ſhall hear of the approaching Terrors; the preſent Devaſtation
of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <pb n="311" facs="tcp:102964:168"/>Univerſal Conqueſts of the
<hi>Oſmans.</hi> The King of the Country ſhall receive thoſe
diſtreſs'd Fugitives with open Arms, and ſhall aſſign them certain
Portions of Land, where they may build Houſes and Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for
themſelves and their Families; there being Abundance of waſte Ground in
that Iſland, which they may manure and improve to their Own and the Publick
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>After this, ſays he, ſhall ariſe a certain Man in
<hi>England</hi> from his Obſcure Center; a Perſon fill'd with all Manner
of Divine Knowledge and Wiſdom, endu'd with the Spirit of <hi>Prophecy,</hi>
of a Graceful Aſpect, and Elegant Speech, of a Compos'd Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Calm
Addreſs, a Man Mild, Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, Temperate, Chaſte and Merciful above the
Reſt of Humane Race. People ſhall let their Eyes fall on the Ground, when
they meet him in the Streets, even before they know what he is; overcome by the
Luſtre of Modeſty, Grace and Vertue which ſhines in his Countenance. A
Perſon highly belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Man ſhall meet the Three Fugitive <hi>Cardinals</hi> in
an Hour of Deſtiny. Then that which lay long ſmothering, ſhall
ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly burſt forth into a Flame. The Light of <hi>God</hi> ſhall be
diffus'd through his Soul; his Heart ſhall be like a Lamp, and his Tongue
ſhall utter marvellous Things. When he opens his Mouth in divulging the
Myſteries of <hi>God,</hi> his Words ſhall be like <pb n="312" facs="tcp:102964:169"/>the Sparks of an Eternal Fire, kindling Flames of Love in the
Breaſts of the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The <hi>Cardinals</hi> ſhall riſe from their
Places and run to embrace him. A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Chief <hi>Biſhops</hi> and
<hi>Prieſts</hi> of the Land ſhall be aſſembled by the King's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
where the Three <hi>Cardinals</hi> alſo ſhall be preſent; and after
mature Deliberation, with Unanimous Conſent, they ſhall call for the Holy
Oyl of Conſecration, and ſhall anoint him: They ſhall proclaim him the
Great <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Patriarch</hi> of the <hi>Faithful;</hi> The

               </p>
               <p>He ſhall ſhew them a new Pattern of the <hi>Law</hi> of
<hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son of <hi>Mary;</hi> or rather the Old and True One,
freed from the Corruptions and Errors which have been ſuperinduc'd for many
Ages. Their Hearts ſhall yield as to an Oracle, and the King of the Country
ſhall approve of their Council. So ſhall all thoſe of the Noble and the
Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, whoſe good Fate is written in their Foreheads. As for the Reſt,
they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their Incredulity.</p>
               <p>This Holy Perſon ſhall reform the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of all the
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Churches, utterly aboliſh the Uſe of <hi>Images</hi>
and <hi>Pictures,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the <hi>Jews</hi> of their
<hi>Infidelity,</hi> and chaſe away the Darkneſs of <hi>Superſtition</hi>
from Earth. He ſhall argue with Reaſons ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and cogent, ſo
clear and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that none but the wilfully obſtinate,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

divulges, or <pb n="313" facs="tcp:102964:169"/>oppoſe his Authentick Miſſions.
Thouſands ſhall be converted by the Dint of his Word, and Ten Thouſands
by his Exemplary Life. For he ſhall go up and down preaching and doing Good
Works throughout <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> till the Number of his Proſelytes
is complete. Then he ſhall ſend <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and
<hi>Meſſengers</hi> into <hi>Swedeland, Denmark, Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> and other
Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> who ſhall likewiſe convert an Innumerable
Multitude to his <hi>Law.</hi> Foreign <hi>Princes</hi> ſhall ſend their
Embaſſadors to the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and to him; for he
ſhall be at the King's Right Hand. They ſhall enter into <hi>Leagues</hi>
and <hi>Covenants,</hi> and all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes ſhall be at
Unity. Mighty Armies ſhall be rais'd in the <hi>North,</hi> who ſhall come
down and give new Courage to the oppreſs'd <hi>Nazarenes</hi> of the
<hi>Weſt.</hi> They ſhall all take up Arms, and chaſe the
<hi>Oſmans</hi> back again to their own Country, recovering the Wealth which
they had taken from them.</p>
               <p>After this, by an Univerſal Agreement of the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> this Holy Perſon ſhall be proclaim'd the <hi>Great
Paſtor</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> a prodigious Army ſhall be gather'd
toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of all the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations, to conduct him to the
<hi>Holy Land,</hi> and to crown him in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> They ſhall
vanquiſh and exterminate the <hi>Oſmans</hi> out of <hi>Palaeſtine</hi>
and all the adjacent Regions. Then ſhall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be re-built
Gloriouſly, and the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> with <hi>Saphires</hi> and
<hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raulds.</hi> That City ſhall be the Seat of the <pb n="314" facs="tcp:102964:170"/>
                  <hi>Chriſtian Mufti's,</hi> this New <hi>Patriarch,</hi> and his
<hi>Succeſſors,</hi> to the Day of <hi>Doom.</hi> Then ſhall the Eyes of
the <hi>Jews</hi> be open'd: They ſhall acknowledge <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Son
of <hi>Mary</hi> to be the <hi>True Meſſias,</hi> whom they have ſo
frequently Curſed. In a word, he ſays, Both <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> People of all Nations, ſhall reſort to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or ſend thither their Gifts and Preſents. It ſhall
become the Miſtreſs of the whole Earth.</p>
               <p>Sage <hi>Cheik;</hi> This is the Subſtance of what my Couſin

               <p>I Think all the ſenſible World are inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive into the

Stateſmen, whilſt living; and now he is dead, his <hi>Memoirs</hi> and
<hi>Maxims</hi> ſerve as a Chart and Compaſs, by which the Politicians
ſteer their Courſe, to avoid the Rocks and Shelves which threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a
Kingdom, or Commonwealth, both in the Tempeſts of War, and the Serene Calms
of Peace.</p>
               <p>Thou haſt formerly receiv'd ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks from me on the
Life of this Great Miniſter: Yet I am not ſurpriz'd at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thy
laſt <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> which require a farther Account of him. No body can
know too much of a Man who was the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of his Time; and not only
ſtartled the wiſeſt of his <hi>Contemporaries,</hi> by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
Actions; but has puzzl'd all that ſurvive him, to trace his Footſteps.</p>
               <p>Undoubtedly, <hi>France</hi> owes to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, all her
preſent Grandeur, with the Hopes ſhe has of encreaſing it. To him ſhe
is indebted for her Conqueſts in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <pb n="316" facs="tcp:102964:171"/>Sicily,
Catalonia, Piedmont,</hi> and the <hi>German</hi> Frontiers. 'Twas He firſt
taught Her the complete Way to Humble Her Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Neighbours, and to
ſuppreſs her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Domeſticks. He much abated the troubleſome
Weight of a <hi>Crown,</hi> and made it ſit Lighter on the Head of
<hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. Whilſt <hi>Cardinal Mazarini,</hi> his Succeſſor in
the <hi>Prime Miniſtry,</hi> acting by the ſame Principles, render'd it as
ſoft and eaſie to the preſent King, as the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s
Turbant. In a Word, through the Efficacy of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi>'s <hi>Politicks,
Lewis</hi> XIV. is become the moſt Abſolute <hi>Monarch</hi> in
<hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> For he either undermines, or over-reaches his Enemies,
by ſpecious Treaties of Peace, where he is ſure to have the better on't; or
he runs them down with the Force of War. To conclude, he has a long Head, and a
longer Sword, which all will confeſs that have to do with him. And this is
the pure Reſult of <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s <hi>Memoirs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet after all, that <hi>Miniſter</hi> had his blind ſide
too, as well as other Mortals. Publick Vertues, and Private Vices;
State-Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Perſonal Frailties. He ſerv'd his Maſter, with a
Zeal and Fidelity, with a Wiſdom and Courage, difficult to be match'd; but he
ſerv'd himſelf after the Common Manner of Men. He indulg'd his Favourite
Paſſions, which were Love, Jealouſie, and Revenge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:102964:171"/>There is a Letter of mine Regiſter'd in

<hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and other Ladies of Prime Quality. Nay, there are not
wanting ſuch as confidently report, That he had Two Children by one of his
own Nieces. And Verſes were ſpread about on that Subject.</p>
               <p>As he cheriſh'd this ſoft Inclination to Women, ſo he was

another Friar named Father <hi>Angel,</hi> provok'd ſome Satyrical Wit, to

be with him when he dyed. It was during the Siege of <hi>Briſac,</hi> a City
on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which was then upon the Point of ſurrendring to the
<hi>French:</hi> And the News coming to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> juſt as Father
<hi>Joſeph</hi> was in his laſt Agonies, he came to his Bed-ſide, and
laying his Mouth cloſe to the poor Friar's Ear, cryed out as loud as he
could, <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ráge, Couráge, mon Pere, Nous avous pris

One Day the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who hated him mortally, went to his
Palace, under Pretence of giving him a Viſit, but really with a Deſign to
Stab him. However, as ſoon as he came into the <hi>Cardinal</hi>'s
Preſence, his Noſe fell a Bleeding. Which appearing to him as an Ominous
Preſage of what he was going about, he was ſtruck with ſome Remorſe;
and frankly confeſſing his Deſign to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> begg'd his
Pardon. That cunning Miniſter diſſembl'd his Reſentments, knowing the
Duke was not a Man of Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution <pb n="320" facs="tcp:102964:173"/>enough to undertake
ſo bold an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unleſs he had been extremely animated by ſome body
near him; he preſently refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on Monſieur <hi>Puylaurent,</hi> the
Duke's Chief Favourite. Immediately he decreed his Ruine; and to effect it with
more Eaſe, he pretended an extraordinary Friendſhip to him, offering him
one of his Nieces in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. <hi>Monſieur Puylaurent</hi> who
ſuſpected not the Train which was laid for him, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the Propoſal
with much Joy, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thereby to raiſe and eſtabliſh his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
under the Protection of his Potent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. In fine, he marry'd the
<hi>Cardinal</hi>'s Niece, but liv'd not to enjoy her; for on the very Nuptial
Day, the <hi>Cardinal</hi> cauſed him to be arreſted and ſent Priſoner
to the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile;</hi> where he was poiſoned by a Friar, in a Glaſs of
Wine. As ſoon as he had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the Fatal Potion, the Friar told him, It
was neceſſary for him to confeſs his Sins that very Moment, in regard he
had but a few Minutes to live. <hi>Monſieur Puylaurent</hi> threw the Glaſs
at the Friar's Head, giving him Two or Three ſwinging Curſes, and then fell
on his Knees, to Confeſſion; which being perform'd, he expir'd.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was very ſingular and
Ingenious in the Execution of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, as if he endeavour'd to perſwade
the World, That he fulfill'd the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Talio,</hi> which
requires an Eye for an Eye, and puniſhes by an exact Kind of Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As
it happen'd in the Caſe of the <pb n="321" facs="tcp:102964:173"/>Dukes of <hi>Guize,
Montmorency,</hi> and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Baſſompierre.</hi> Theſe were
the Heads of a Faction which diametrically oppos'd the <hi>Cardinal</hi> and
his Party. He was the Grand Eye-ſore, the Chief Obſtacle of their
Deſign'd Prevalence at the <hi>Court.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they cou'd but once
remove him out of the VVay, they thought themſelves ſure of the King's Ear
in all Things. To effect this, they conſulted together, how to diſpoſe of
him. The Duke of <hi>Guize</hi> was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, he ſhould not be kill'd, in
regard he was a Prince of the Holy Church, but that he ſhould be ſent to
<hi>Rome,</hi> there to attend the proper Affairs of his
<hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, among the Reſt of his purpl'd
Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. The Duke of <hi>Montmorency</hi> was clearly for taking off his
Head. But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Baſſompierre</hi> was againſt both theſe
Methods: <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if he be ſent to</hi> Rome, <hi>he will
be always plotting of Miſchief againſt us. And it would be an Eternal
Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh to</hi> France, <hi>if the Purple of the Holy Church ſhould be
ſtain'd with Blood. Let us ſend him cloſe Priſoner to the</hi>
Baſtile, <hi>where he may ſpend the Remainder of his Days in writing
Learned Books.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> who had his Agents buſie about in all
Parts, ſoon was inform'd of this Conſult: and he retaliated every Man's
Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon its own Author. For he baniſh'd the Duke of <hi>Guize,</hi>
confining him to <hi>Rome.</hi> He beheaded the Duke of <hi>Montmorency;</hi> 
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:102964:174"/>and impriſon'd Monſieur de <hi>Baſſompierre</hi>

               <p>SUch is the Zeal I have to demonſtrate how highly I value thy

having Time enough, will entertain thee with an Abſtract of what I know to be
moſt Remarkable in the State of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> both at preſent
and in Ancient Times.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place, it will be convenient for thee to know,
That this City was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly call'd <hi>Byzantium,</hi> from one <hi>Byzas,
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi> of the <hi>Spartan</hi> Fleet, under <hi>Pauſanias</hi> the
<hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sparta,</hi> who laid the Firſt Foundations of it. The
Story is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:102964:176"/>In Old Time the <hi>Graecians</hi> having
a Mind to build a New City in ſome Part of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and being at Odds
about the Choice of a Spot of Ground ſuitable to ſo Great and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant an
Undertaking, they at laſt agreed to conſult the <hi>Oracle</hi> of
<hi>Apollo.</hi> They did ſo, and were anſwer'd, <hi>That they ſhould lay
the Foundations of the City, right over-againſt the Blind Men:</hi> For ſo
the Inhabitants of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> were call'd, becauſe when they were
upon the ſame Deſign of founding a New City, they could not diſcern
between the Fertility of the Soil on what ſide the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pontis,</hi> where
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> now ſtands; and the Barrenneſs and Deſart State
of the Ground where they built, on the other ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Panſanias</hi> therefore buſying his Mind about theſe
Things, and pitching right upon the Sence of the <hi>Oracle,</hi> caus'd the
Foundations of the City to be laid exactly over againſt <hi>Chalcedon:</hi>
And when it was finiſh'd it was call'd <hi>Byzantium,</hi> as I have ſaid,
from <hi>Byzas</hi> who had the Overſight of the Work.</p>
               <p>It retain's this Name many Years and Ages, flouriſhing in a
high Degree among the other Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſteem'd the <hi>Gate</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> by
which the Mutual Commerce of both thoſe Quarters of the Earth was
interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably held up.</p>
               <p>But after the Days of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> there aroſe an
<hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
This Prince, as 'tis Recorded <pb n="328" facs="tcp:102964:177"/>in <hi>Roman</hi>
Hiſtories, ſaw a <hi>Viſion</hi> in the Air when he was at the Head of
his Army mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching againſt <hi>Licinius,</hi> and preparing to give Battle.
He and all his Soldiers beheld the Figure of a Croſs, with theſe Words
plainly engraven in the Firmament: <hi>In hoc Signo vinces. Conſtantine</hi>
took this for a Good <hi>Omen,</hi> and caus'd a Standard of Silver to be made
exactly after the ſame Form: To which he appointed Eifty Standard-Bearers, to
carry it by Turns, and to guard it: For it was exceeding Rich, being
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſs'd all o'er with Rubies, Diamonds, Pearls, and other precious Jewels
of the <hi>Orient.</hi> He built a Pavilion alſo for the Glorious Idol; and
being inſtructed in the <hi>Chriſtian Law</hi> by <hi>Euſebius
Pamphilus,</hi> and other Learned <hi>Mollah's,</hi> he was at laſt Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by <hi>Silveſter</hi> the <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Great <hi>Monarch,</hi> as the Story goes, being very
Pious, and having conceiv'd a profound Veneration for <hi>Pope
Silveſter,</hi> left him the <hi>Dominion</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a great
Part of <hi>Italy,</hi> whilſt he remov'd the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Court to the
<hi>East,</hi> and took up his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at <hi>Byzantium,</hi> which he
augmented with Innumerable ſtately Edifices; ſtriving, if poſſible, to
equal it with the Majeſty and Grandeur of <hi>Rome.</hi> He collected
whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was Precious and Beautiful in all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> to adorn
the City withal: Witneſs the Palaces of Superb Architecture the Admirable
Height and Form of Diverſe Obelisks and Pillars, all made of Marble, 
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102964:177"/>Porphyry, or Jaſper. Not to inſiſt on the
Prodigious Strength and Firmneſs of the Walls, the Coſtly Aqueducts, with
other Serviceable Things. At laſt, that he might conſecrate himſelf to
Immortal Renown, he call'd this City by his own Name, <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
or, the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Conſtantine:</hi> By which Name it is known even
to this Day. It was alſo called <hi>New Rome,</hi> after it once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the
Seat of the <hi>Chriſtian Emperours:</hi> In whoſe Poſſeſſion it
remain'd, till it was taken by <hi>Mahomet</hi> II. Invincible

<hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Nazarenes;</hi> on the Third Day of the Week which

               </p>
               <p>It had been a Grand Neglect and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight in any Prince ſo
Potent and Politick as <hi>Mahomet</hi> was, to ſuffer ſuch an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to eſcape as Fortune offer'd him, of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the moſt Opulent and Glorious
City in the VVorld: For there was an Irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable <hi>Schiſm</hi> broke
forth between the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and
<hi>Weſt.</hi> There were Two or Three <hi>Popes</hi> at the ſame time,
quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling in <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>Supremacy;</hi> there was a VVar of
Fifty Years ſtanding between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
which unhing'd all the <hi>Courts</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> The
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> had long before, by dear-bought Experience (the Loſs of
many Hundred Thouſand Men and Infinite Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, conſum'd in thoſe
vain and raſh Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which they Sanctified with the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious 
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:102964:178"/>Title of the <hi>Holy War;</hi>) found, that it was not
eaſie to wreſt one Town of Strength out of the Hands of the Tenacious
<hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> much leſs to defend it long, or ſave their moſt
important Cities from the Fury of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Reprizal. They were
ſick and ſurfeited with the Viſionary Stuff of <hi>Peter</hi> the
<hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;</hi> and all Illuminato's like him, grew out of Faſhion. Every
Prince and State in <hi>Weſtern Chriſtendom,</hi> began to mind their own
Intereſt. No more Enthuſiaſtick Tales of that Kind wou'd go down: The
Great Ones had open'd their Eyes.</p>
               <p>Beſides, he that was then <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Greece,
Conſtantinus Paleologus,</hi> was look'd upon by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
as a Tyrant, the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Tyrants, and Uſurper. The <hi>Graecians</hi>
ſtill retain'd the Black Memoirs of thoſe horrid and nefandous Tragedies,
acted by <hi>Michael Andronicus, John,</hi> and <hi>Manuel,</hi> the
Pedeceſſors and Anceſtors of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</hi> And they had
ſuch a particular Averſion for his Government, that tho' there were
Infinite-Treaſures of Gold and Silver in the Hands of the Rich Citizens of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when that City was beſieg'd by <hi>Mahomet</hi>
II. yet no Man wou'd part with the leaſt Sum of Money, to ſupport the
<hi>Publick Cauſe:</hi> But choſe rather in a Kind of revengeful and
deſperate Sullenneſs, to fall into the Hands of the Victorious
<hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> than to afford their Hated <hi>Sovereign</hi> any
Relief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:102964:178"/>Thus fell that Queen of Cities, the Glory
of all the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> under the Power of our Puiſſant
<hi>Emperours,</hi> in whoſe Poſſeſſion it remains to this Day; and
may it ſo remain, till the <hi>Moon</hi> ſhall be in her laſt Wane, and
the <hi>Sun</hi> ceaſe to ſhine on the World.</p>
               <p>In the mean Time, I will entertain thee <hi>en Paſſant,</hi>
as the <hi>French</hi> call it, with a ſhort View of the Chief Magnificences
in <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

               <p>That which firſt draws the Admiration of Travellers, is the
Glorious Structure of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Sophia,</hi> a Temple conſecrated to the
Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal WISDOM, by which the Worlds were made: Built by the Emperour
<hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> with inimitable Magnificence; tho' af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Spoil'd
and Plunder'd of its chiefeſt Ornaments, by the greedy Soldiers of
<hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> II. whom I have ſo often mention'd; and Six Parts of it
entirely ſubverted by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Emperours.</p>
               <p>Pity it was, if furious and ill-grounded Superſtition was the
Cauſe of ſuch deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ruines. What can be ſaid of thoſe who
demoliſh'd the <hi>Sub-Fana</hi> of the Third Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, celebrated in the
Univerſal Hiſtory of the VVorld? That of <hi>Diana</hi> at
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> 'tis true, was the Pattern; yet 'twas not much beyond it.
<hi>Schelomo</hi>'s boaſted <hi>Fane</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> without
Iron Pins or Nails, or other VVork of the Hammer, excell'd but a little in the
Artifice and Symmetry. Indeed, the Luſtre of <hi>Sion</hi>'s.
<hi>Moſch,</hi> was more Radiant and Glorious in VVorkman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Gold, the
VValls and Floor being <pb n="332" facs="tcp:102964:179"/>over-laid with that Metal, and the
Roof on the out-ſide was, as it were, ſtudded with Spikes of Beaten Gold
ſo thick, that there was not Room for a Bird to perch between them. And this
was done to prevent the Prophanation of the <hi>Temple</hi> by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on
it.</p>
               <p>VVhen the <hi>Sun</hi> ſhone in his full ſtrength, the
covering of the <hi>Temple</hi> thus adorn'd, look'd like a Firmament
glittering with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Stars.</p>
               <p>But to return to the <hi>Moſch</hi> of <hi>Sancta
So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> let us conſider it in its Primitive State, and we ſhall find
ſome Excellent Curioſities. Among the Reſt, there was a Candleſtick or
Sconce of Beaten Gold, ſo admirably contriv'd, That it ſpontaneouſly fed
the Bowls of Seven Branches with a conſtant Stream of Oil, which by equal
Meaſures flow'd into them, from the Hollow of the Shaft. So that if the Flame
but of one ſingle One, had wanted Aliment, all the Reſt muſt have been
extinguiſh'd at the ſame Time.</p>
               <p>The VValls of this Glorious <hi>Moſch,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and
without, preſent the Eye with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but VVhite Marble, Porphyry; and other
Precious Stones. The Roof is of a Prodigious Height, cover'd with Lead
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but proudly Oſtentous of its inward Cieling, which is divided into
Vaults and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches richly adorn'd with Golden Fret-work; and ſupported by
Pillars of <hi>Cyprian</hi> Jaſper, pureſt VVhite Marble, and Porphyry.
There <pb n="333" facs="tcp:102964:179"/>is a Marble Stone in the <hi>Moſch,</hi> had in
great Reverence by the True Faithful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Tradition goes, <hi>That
on it</hi> Mary, <hi>the Mother of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>waſh'd the
Infant-Prophet</hi>'s <hi>Linen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are alſo under the <hi>Moſch,</hi> Innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Vaules
or Oratories, full of Altars and Sepulchres: But there is no Acceſs to them,
in Regard the Doors are wall'd up.</p>
               <p>In a Place not far from theſe, you find Ten huge Veſſels
full of Oyl, reſerv'd there ever-ſince the Days of <hi>Conſtantine the
Great,</hi> yet remains Uncorrupted, being of Colour VVhite like Milk. It is an
Inexpiable Crime for any, but the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians or
Surgeons, to uſe or touch it. And they compound certain Medicaments with it,
for the Service of him and his <hi>Serail.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I remember what I have read in a very Authentick
<hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> concerning an Oil made by certain Holy Perſons who
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the Secret of it. As the Story goes, it was Extracted from the Leaves
and Chips of VVood which are found floating in the Rivers that deſcend out of
<hi>Paradiſe.</hi> This Oil they compounded with other Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and
perform'd Cures therewith, which were eſteem'd Miraculous. It was ſent from
one Prince to another, as a Sacred and Invaluable Treaſure. Till at laſt it
came into the Hands of the <hi>Eaſtern Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,</hi> who preſided over
the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of the <hi>Greek, Armenian,</hi> and <hi>Egyptian
Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:</hi> VVho pretend to the only true My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery <pb n="334" facs="tcp:102964:180"/>and Power of making it at this very Day. And that tho' the Ancient
<hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> were formerly preſented with a Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Portion of it ſo long as they remain'd in Communion with the
<hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> yet after <hi>Victor</hi> once had
made the Fatal <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which never cou'd be healed ſince, the Holy
Favour was deny'd to his Succeſſors: VVho inſtead of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Genuine Oil, were forc'd to counterfeit it, uſing a Spurious Unguent, to
preſerve the Authority of their Religious Sacraments. And hence, they ſay,
it comes to paſs, that few or none are ever healed by the <hi>Extreme
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of the Latin Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> knows, whether this be Truth or no. But I am apt to
think, That the Ten Jarrs of Oil before-mention'd which lie under the
<hi>Moſch</hi> of <hi>Aja-Sophian,</hi> are Reliques of the Ancient
<hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> who had the Secret of
compounding the Myſterious Extract.</p>
               <p>From the Place where theſe Veſſels are kept, you deſcend
into the <hi>Dormitories</hi> of Royal <hi>Ottoman</hi> Carkaſſes, the Sons
of our Renowned <hi>Emperors.</hi> From thence you paſs into Two Caverns; One
leading directly to the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the Other extending it ſelf under
the Buildings of the City, by a vaſt long Tract of Ground. I know no Uſe
there is at preſent of the Former Cave: but the Latter ſerves for a
VVork-Room, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poor Silk-Spinſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:102964:180"/>This Letter wou'd be too tedious, if I
ſhould deſcribe all the other <hi>Moſchs,</hi> and Buildings of Note in
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> VVhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to tire thee, I will reſerve what
remains to be ſaid of that Glorious City, for other

               </p>
               <p>In the mean Time, with an Affectionate <hi>Conge</hi> of my Soul

               <p>NOw I will perform the Promiſe I made thee long agoe; which
was, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thee with an <hi>Idea</hi> of the different
<hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Policies</hi> of theſe <hi>Nazarene King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi>
and <hi>States:</hi> VVherein, I will begin with <hi>Germany,</hi> which is, as
it were, the laſt Retrenchment of the Declining <hi>Roman Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Annals</hi> affirm, That in the <hi>Reign</hi> of
<hi>Charles</hi> V. when the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> Invaded <hi>Auſtria</hi>
with Innumerable Forces, that <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> oppos'd them with an Army of
90000 Foot, and 30000 Horſe. <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> II. went beyond him, and
rais'd 100000 Foot, and 35000 Horſe. Neither was Corn dear in ſo vaſt an
Army. It is certain, That the <hi>German Emperour</hi> can, upon Occaſion,
ſend into the Field 200000 expert Soldiers. It is moreover obſerv'd, That
from the Year 1560 of the <hi>Chriſtians Hegira,</hi> even to theſe
preſent Times, there has been no VVar between <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and the
<hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> wherein many Thouſands of <hi>Germans</hi> have not
ſerv'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:102964:181"/>Their beſt <hi>Infantry</hi> is gather'd
out of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, Auſtria,</hi> and <hi>Weſtphalia.</hi> And their
choiceſt <hi>Cavalry</hi> come out of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Juliers,</hi> and
<hi>Frankendal.</hi> Both Foot and Horſe fight better and more
ſucceſsfully in an Open Plain or Field, than in Narrow, Covert Places,
ſuch as Lanes and Woods <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they are not good at taking
Advantages of Ground, or at politick Skirmiſhes, and cunning Ambuſcades.
They have not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to lie long waiting the Enemies Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, neither care
they to divide their Main Body into Fragments or Detachments; but they love to
wedge themſelves altogether in Form of a Triangle, and ſo march with grave
and ſlow Pace, that ſo they may break through the Enemies, and confound
their Order, which they eſteem a certain Step to Victory. They fight better
alſo under a <hi>Foreign Commander,</hi> than a <hi>General</hi> of their own
<hi>Nation.</hi> They cannot endure the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Afflictions of a long
Siege; but when once they begin to ſmart for want of Proviſions, they
ſoon Capitulate and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render. Neither have they more Patience in a Camp to
bear the Injuries of Weather: But they make haſt to ſet upon the Enemy, and
decide the Quarrel in a pitch'd Combat: Wherein if their Firſt Onſet fail,
they ſeem like Men Stupify'd, Aſtoniſh'd, or in a Trance, not knowing
whether they had beſt to renew the Aſſault, or to fly: And, if they
oncefly, there's no rallying them again. Yet theſe Armies are not rais'd
without a vaſt Expence, <pb n="338" facs="tcp:102964:182"/>nor maintain'd without a
greater, being cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd with a Train of VVomen, Children, and Servants; who
conſume the Proviſions of the Soldiers, ſo that many Times they ſtarve
for want of common Ammunition-Bread.</p>
               <p>Their Horſes may be call'd rather ſtrong than ſprightly,
and bold; being, for the moſt Part, taken from the Plough, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rural
Drudgeries. In a word, they are like their Riders, Phlegmatick and Dull; having
this alſo peculiar in their Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that at the ſight of Blood,
they ſhrink, and are ready to faint: Whereas, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe
gather freſh Courage from this Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> alſo have conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by Sea;
but they ſeldom make Uſe of them, unleſs it be againſt the
<hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Suedes.</hi> Beſides all this, their Auxiliary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are not to be forgot, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes;
from the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Lorrain;</hi> and ſometimes from the
Truſty <hi>Suiſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there are Two Things chiefly want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this
<hi>Empire,</hi> amidſt all its Numerous Forces: One is, Unity and Concord
among the Subjects; Another is, a fix'd Reſolution and Readineſs to
enterprize any Thing of Moment. Their <hi>Hans</hi> Towns are always Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of the Neighbouring Princes. And theſe again give 'em Occaſion to
ſuſpect their Power, and hate their Intereſt, which they ſo often
employ againſt them, by encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="339" facs="tcp:102964:182"/>on their
Privileges. Then the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are always
quarelling: And one <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> perpetually
Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting another. Hence it falls out, That the Princes go ſo
unwillingly and rarely to the <hi>Diets:</hi> And when they come there, they
ſpin out ſo much Time in adjuſting their private Pretenſions, Claims,
and Privileges; in performing of State-Ceremonies; and in deliberating
concerning the Publick Good, whilſt every one contradicts his Neighbour, and
labours with all his Might to eſtabliſh his own Opinion, and get it
paſs'd into a Decree, by the Sanction of the <hi>Diet;</hi> that before they
come to any Reſolves, an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and Potent Enemy might ruſh into the
Heart of the Country, and even take all theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Blockheads
Priſoners.</p>
               <p>The <hi>German Empire</hi> is <hi>Elective;</hi> and the Power

<hi>Count Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine, Maſter</hi> of the
<hi>Imperial</hi> Palace. The Sixth is, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxony,
Marſhal</hi> or <hi>Sword-bearer</hi> to the <hi>Emperor.</hi> The Seventh

<hi>Abbots</hi> of a lower Degree 52. With Innumerable Others too tedious to be

of a Meaner Figure. They number 49 Barons and Free Lords, 90
<hi>Hans</hi>-Towns, and 10 Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Empire.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>German Diets,</hi> this Order is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd: VVhen
the <hi>Emperor</hi> is plac'd in the <hi>Throne,</hi> the
<hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Triers</hi> takes his Place juſt over againſt
him: He of <hi>Mentz</hi> ſits next to the <hi>Emperor</hi> on his Right
Hand; the Second Place belongs to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and
the Third to the <hi>Count Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> On the
<hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror</hi>'s Left Hand, the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Colen</hi>
takes the Firſt Place; the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxony</hi> the next; and the
<hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> the Third.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hans</hi>-Towns, which acknowledge no other
<hi>Lord</hi> but the <hi>Emperor,</hi> are grovern'd by their own Municipal
<hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> In ſome of them, the <hi>Common
People</hi> bear Rule; in others, a Mixture of the <hi>Commons</hi> and
<hi>Nobles,</hi> and many of them wholly obey the <hi>Nobility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Man ſalutes by the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Emperor,</hi> him
whom the Princes have Elected to that <pb n="341" facs="tcp:102964:183"/>Dignity, till he be

<hi>Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or King of
<hi>Germany;</hi> but not <hi>Emperor,</hi> till the <hi>Coronation</hi> is
finiſh'd. Nor does the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> even after he is Crown'd and
Eſtabliſh'd in the <hi>Throne,</hi> exerciſe an <hi>Abſolute Power</hi>
in all things; Affairs of Importance being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally referr'd to the
<hi>Publick Diets</hi> or <hi>Divans</hi> of the <hi>Empire:</hi> Where the
<hi>Electoral Princes</hi> deliberate all Things, on whom the very Power of the
<hi>Emperour</hi> himſelf depends.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Diets</hi> are very confus'd and tedious, in Regard
the <hi>Princes</hi> ſeldom appear there in their own Perſons; but ſend
their <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi> and <hi>Deputies,</hi> who yet have not full
Power to conclude any Thing without Particular Orders from their Reſpective

<hi>Couriers</hi> to inform the <hi>Princes</hi> of all emergent Counſels and
Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions, and in waiting for their Expreſs Inſtructions, and
Anſwers again.</p>
               <p>In a word, conſidering the Diverſity of Intereſts carried
on by the <hi>Electoral Princes,</hi> their Mutual Feuds and Diſſentions,
Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Animoſities, and Foreign Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both on
<hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Politick</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; it is a Miracle that this
tottering <hi>Empire</hi> ſtands ſo long, and does not fall to Ruin:

               <p>THy Memory is like the Smell of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe; refreſhing as
VVine of <hi>Tenedos</hi> in a Goblet of pure Gold. VVhen my Heart is almoſt
dead with Melancholy; when I can find no Pleaſure in Company abroad, and the
very Elements of which I am made, frown upon me; when the Time of Night forces
me to come home Sighing as to a Priſon, and the Hangings of my Bed-Chamber
look dull and ſeem to be painted with horrid Tragedies: In a word, when every
Thing in Nature appears in an angry threatning Fit, then I think of thee, my
Friend, and that Thought relieves me. Thy belov'd <hi>Idea</hi> is a perfect
<hi>Talisman,</hi> working VVonders in my Soul. It Charms or Countercharms, as
my Occaſions do require. No Fears, or Griefs, or other Melancholy
Paſſions dare abide its Energy: As ſoon as it appears, each baneful
Thought is gone; the Troops of ſad <hi>Chimaerae's</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh like the

Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the Malice of moſt Men; ſo vigilant and ſtudious for an
Opportunity of doing Miſchief. And as for theſe <hi>Infidels,</hi> my
Converſation is, for the moſt part, <hi>Hiſtrionick.</hi> I am
conſtrain'd to act to the Life, a very Zealous <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a
<hi>Catholick:</hi> When, <hi>God</hi> knows, my Heart keeps not time with my
Exteriour Actions and Words. Not but that there are Scepticks among the
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as well as among the <hi>True-Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:</hi> But they
are generally very private and reſerv'd: For open Blaſphemy, or what is
reputed ſo here, is certainly puniſh'd with Death.</p>
               <p>I ſometimes meet with Ingenious and Candid Souls, with whom I
can diſcourſe freely, and like a Man that doubts of many Things, which
others currantly believe. Yet we dare not truſt each other too far, nor the
very Air into which our Words vaniſh, after it has help'd to form 'em; leſt
ſome ſly envious <hi>Daemon</hi> ſhou'd catch the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient ſound,
and reverberate the yet articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Body of Particles which made it, into
ſome Inquiſitive Ear, to ruine us. For there are certain buſie
Goſſiping <hi>Eccho's,</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd up and down the Elements, which
are always liſtning to the Words of Mortals: <pb n="345" facs="tcp:102964:185"/>And if the
ſpightful <hi>Elves</hi> can but take Hold of any Syllable, to do a Man an
Injury, they are big till they have vented it. Yet they make no Shew nor
Noiſe, but whiſper out their Tales in Secret; ſometimes in Dead of Night,
when Men are faſt aſleep; at other times when they are deeply muſing on
the hidden Things of Nature. For, 'tis only to the VViſe, the Sage, the
Noble, and the Great, that they reveal theſe Paſſages, beeauſe 'tis
ſuch alone have Ears to hear Them. They haunt the Bed-Chambers of Kings and
Princes, to tell 'em News in Dreams. They are the ſwifteſt Couriers in the
VVorld: For they have VVings, and fly from <hi>Court</hi> to <hi>Court,</hi>
and from one <hi>Climate</hi> to another in a Moments time. They're always
buzzing in the Ears of <hi>Stateſmen</hi> and great <hi>Politicians,</hi> to
whom they ſhew the Dark Intrigues of Foreign and Domeſtick Enemies. Thus
are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies and Plots of Rebels oft diſcover'd, tho' manag'd ne'er
ſo ſecretly. They viſit, now and then, the Cloſets of
<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and ſuch as love the Sciences. Men of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
Souls; whoſe Thoughts are volatile and pure, their Phancies lively and
vegete. To theſe they unfold the covert Myſteries of Nature, and ſhew 'em
Things to come. They frame th' <hi>Idea's</hi> of remote unknown Events, which
they imprint upon the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctile Minds of <hi>Prophets</hi> and Holy Men;
Inſpiring them with ſtrange and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Preſages of what ſhall
ſhortly happen <pb n="346" facs="tcp:102964:186"/>to themſelves or others, whether it be
Good or Evil. For theſe Buſie-bodies are the Daughters of the World's great
Soul; and they inherit an Univerſal Senſe and Feeling of whatſoever
happens in the Elements. 'Tis true, ſome Knowledge they acquire by Study and
Obſervation, even as we Mortals do; but at a far ſwifter Rate. Their Airy
Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies do not ſo oppreſs their Intellectual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as our groſs
Hulks of Fleſh do ours. We're forc'd to Dig and Plough, to Sow and Harrow for
ſmall Returns of Science. Our Soil is barren, it muſt be manur'd and
cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated with Art and Coſt, before it yields a tolerable Harveſt of what
deſerves the Name of Solid Knowledge. But theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecate Tenants of the
Air, have no more to do, but to be merely paſſive, and they ſtreight
learn every Thing: For the Eternal <hi>Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> wanders through the
Univerſe, to ſeek out ſuch as will or can imbibe her free
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. She voluntarily ſlides into recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Souls, and fills
them with her Rays. Thus the Sublimer <hi>Genij</hi> of the Air, bask in an
open Orb of Intellectual Light, becauſe they are embodied in the moſt
refin'd and pureſt Matter: Whereas we Mortals, muſt be thankful for her
Illuminations by Retail. She only ſhines on us through Chinks and Cranies of
our Dungeon Fleſh: And yet but ſeldom ſo in direct Beams. Few Men can
boaſt that Privilege. The greateſt Part walk only in the Uncertain Twilight
of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; or at beſt in the faint languid Glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings 
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:102964:186"/>of Humane Reaſon, which like the <hi>Moon,</hi> conveys
the Original Light of Science to us by Reflection, and at ſecond Hand. We're
fain to learn from Books, from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and Experience.</p>
               <p>Courteous <hi>Hali,</hi> thou wilt pardon the Confuſedneſs
and want of Order in this Letter, when thou ſhalt conſider the Force of
Melancholy which firſt prompted me to write it. For, being very ſad, and
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt with Clouds of dark and gloomy Thoughts, which different
Paſſions caus'd to juſtle one againſt another in my troubl'd Mind; I
knew not how to eſcape the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt better than by writing to thee, my
Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Friend, tho' only to expreſs my Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. For when I began,
I knew not what to ſay; but 'twas an Eaſe to write at random, any Thing to

conſiſted in addreſſing to thee, my Dear <hi>Phyſician,</hi> whoſe

               <p>THou ſhalt ſee, That I am a Man of my VVord, and will keep
my Promiſe: For this <hi>Diſpatch</hi> contains a farther De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd to preſent thee with in my
laſt.</p>
               <p>This Famous City is Sixteen Miles in Circuit, and contains Nine
Hundred Thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. 'Tis divided into Three Parts, by the
Intercourſe of certain Arms of the Sea; and almoſt forms the Figure of a
Triangle. The VValls are of an Incredible Height, and encompaſs Seven Hills
within their Extent. One is near the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior</hi>'s <hi>Serail:</hi>
Another is in the Oppoſite Corner of the City, which leads to
<hi>Adriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Between Two others, there lies a Plain, which is call'd
the Great Valley. In this is to be ſeen an Aqueduct of Admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
and Structure, the VVork of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> who by
his convey'd VVater to the City from Seven Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Solyman</hi>
II. augmented it, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Current of VVaters Two Miles beyond the Source
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which run through Seven Hundred and Forty Pipes 
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:102964:187"/>into the City; beſides thoſe which ſerve the
<hi>Moſques,</hi> the <hi>Bathes,</hi> and Houſes of
<hi>Purification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the Extremity of the Town is ſeen the Antique Building of a
Fortreſs, which is call'd, the <hi>Caſtle of the Seven Towers;</hi> a VVork
of Inimitable Architecture. There is a Garriſon in it of Two Hundred and
Fifty Soldiers, not one of which dares to ſet his Foot out of the Caſtle
Gates without the Leave of the <hi>Vizir Azem,</hi> unleſs it be on Two
certain Days in the Year; That is, the Firſt of <hi>Beiram</hi> and
<hi>Ramezan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Place formerly the <hi>Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> us'd to
lay their Treaſures of Gold and Silver; their Arms and Ammunition, their
Books, and whatſoever they eſteem'd Precious. But <hi>Amurat</hi> the Son
of <hi>Sely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> II. tranſlated all theſe Things into the
<hi>Serail';</hi> where they have been kept ever ſince: And this Caſtle is
turn'd into a Priſon for <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> taken
<hi>Captives</hi> by the <hi>True Faithful;</hi> as alſo for Rebellious
<hi>Baſſa's,</hi> and other Perſons of Quality. Here <hi>Coreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,
Vayvod</hi> of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> was ſhut up in the Year 1617. of the
<hi>Chriſtians Aera.</hi> And in the Year 1622. of the ſame Date, the
Rebellious <hi>Janizaries</hi> Impriſoned their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, <hi>Sultan
Oſman,</hi> whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they ſtrangl'd in the ſame Place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:102964:188"/>There are above Two Thouſand Moſques,
Oratories, and Sepulchres within the VValls of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I
have already deſcrib'd that of <hi>Aia-Sophian,</hi> in my laſt. It remains
now, that I ſpeak of Four others, built by ſome of our former
<hi>Emperors.</hi> The Firſt and Chiefeſt, was built by <hi>Sultan
Mahomet</hi> II. to expreſs his Gratitude to <hi>God</hi> for the Taking of
<hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> It is a Magnificent Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, rais'd according to
the Pattern of <hi>Sancta Sophia.</hi> He caus'd a Hundred ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Chambers
to be built round about it, both for the Service of the <hi>Imaum's</hi> and
<hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah's</hi> who belong to the <hi>Moſch;</hi> and for the
Entertainment of Strangers, let them be of what <hi>Nation</hi> or
<hi>Religion</hi> ſoever. He rais'd alſo Fifty other Chambers without
theſe; for the Uſe of the Poor: And endowed the <hi>Moſque</hi> with
Sixty Thouſand Duckats of Yearly Revenue.</p>
               <p>The Second <hi>Moſque</hi> was built by <hi>Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet</hi> II.
the Son of this <hi>Mahomet.</hi> The Third was built by <hi>Selymus</hi> I.
The Fourth by <hi>Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the Magnificent.</hi> The Three laſt of theſe
Princes lie buried, each in his own <hi>Moſch,</hi> under Monuments of a
Superb Figure: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Lamps burning over them and round about them, night
and day, whilſt certain. <hi>Mollah's</hi> pray by Turns, without ceaſing,
for the Health of the Departed <hi>Royal Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the laſt of theſe <hi>Moſchs</hi> which was built, as
I have ſaid, by <hi>Sultan Solyman;</hi> far exceeds all the Reſt, and
comes not ſhort of <pb n="351" facs="tcp:102964:188"/>
                  <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> in the
Richneſs of Marble, Porphyry, and other excellent Materials.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> have Forty Churches and Chapels in
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the <hi>Nazarene</hi> Worſhip.
The <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> have Four. Thoſe of the <hi>Latin Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
have but One, with a <hi>College</hi> annex'd to it for a certain Number of
<hi>Jeſuits.</hi> This is ſeated in <hi>Pera,</hi> which is a kind of
<hi>Suburb</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> have great Liberty in the <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi>
City. Their Habitations are Contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, taking up Nine Principal Streets, and
they have Eight and Thirty <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Walls of the City remain very entire, and are double toward
the Land. There are Nineteen Gates in them; One of which is call'd the <hi>Holy
Gate,</hi> in Reſpect of a vaſt Multitude of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Saints
who lie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a <hi>Chapel</hi> hard by it. It was through this Gate, that
<hi>Mahomet</hi> II. made his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Entry into <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as it were, to prophane the reputed Sanctity of the Place, and
inſult o'er their <hi>Falſe Gods;</hi> whilſt he came to eſtabliſh
the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the <hi>Only True God; Creator</hi>
of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are Abundance of Antique Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the City, as
Pyramids and Obelisks of Admirable Figure and Contrivance. In one Place, there
are Three Serpents of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſtretching themſelves to the Height of Two
Men, and mutually twiſting about <pb n="352" facs="tcp:102964:189"/>each other. The Report
goes, That theſe were erected by a <hi>Magician,</hi> at a Time when the
Citizens were much infeſted with Living Serpents, and that by this
Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they were freed.</p>
               <p>One of theſe has a Wound in the Neck, which was given it by
<hi>Mahomet</hi> II. when he rode into the Vanquiſh'd City. For, he beholding
the Horrid <hi>Idol,</hi> and gueſſing right, that it was the Work of
ſome <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician,</hi> was mov'd with Holy Zeal and Indignation. Wherefore,
couching his Spear, and giving Spurs to his Horſe, he ran full Tilt againſt
it, and wounded one of the Serpents in the Neck, which is ſeen to this
Day.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Pavement there ſtands a very Elegant Column of
Ruſtick Workmanſhip, as they call it: The Marbles of which it conſiſts,
being faſtned together without the Intervention of Mortar, Bitumen, or any
other Cement. It has within a winding Stair-Caſe, by which one may go up to
the Top.</p>
               <p>In this Place, which is call'd the <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome,</hi> the
<hi>Ottoman Grandees</hi> exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on Horſeback, and
ſometimes the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> himſelf: Eſpecially on great
<hi>Feſtivals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Round about it, there are above Two Thouſand little Shops of
Taylors or Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for the Uſe of thoſe who would have their Garments
mended, ſcowr'd and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd at a ſmall Price. And yet out of this 
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102964:189"/>ſo contemptible a Trade, the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>
receives a Yearly Cuſtom of Eleven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Zequins.</hi> By this thou
may'ſt take an Eſtimate of his other Revenues, which flow into his Coffers
from all Parts of ſo vaſt an <hi>Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are above Fourty Thouſand Ware-Houſes and Shops of
Merchants, Brokers, Pedlars, Huckſters, and ſuch like Callings: Each Trade
having their proper <hi>Bazar,</hi> or Mercat, according to the Quality of the
Goods they ſell. But there is one more Eminent than all the reſt, which is
called <hi>Bayſtan;</hi> where be Goldſmiths, Jewellers, and ſuch as deal
in any Manner of fine and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things. This Place is environ'd with very
ſtrong Walls, Six Foot Thick, and is ſhut up every Night by Four double
Gates, and at other Times, as Occaſion requires: So that it looks like a
Little well-fortified Town.</p>
               <p>In this wealthy Mercat, there is a Gallery or <hi>Piazza</hi>
neatly arch'd and ſupported by Twenty Four Pillars. Under this, there are
Abundance of little Shops, Six Foot long, and Four in Breadth. Here all thoſe
precious Commodities are expos'd to Sale on Tables or Counters, and with their
Luſtre dazle the Eyes of ſuch as paſs by.</p>
               <p>Thou may'ſt alſo conjecture at the vaſt Gains of theſe
Merchants, by the Rates which they pay to the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> only for
their Licenſe to ſell in this Place. I have known one Man, that was my
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <pb n="354" facs="tcp:102964:190"/>Acquaintance, give Yearly Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Franks for this Liberty; and he told me, That no Man cou'd enjoy the Freedom of
the Place under that Price, unleſs he had great Favour ſhewn him, which is
very rare; and even then it wou'd not be much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>As one paſſes from this Mercat one way, there ariſes a
ſtately Column of Porphyry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt in many Places with Iron Hoops: And
little diſtant you ſee another more Lofty than this: It is call'd the
Hiſtorical Column, being engraven all over with the Figures of Men. In this
alſo, there is a Stair-Caſe to the Top, but much broken, and in Danger of
falling, if it were not ſtrengthen'd and held together with vaſt Hoops of
Iron.</p>
               <p>The next thing worthy to be ſeen, is the Old Palace of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great:</hi> Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy I ſay to be ſeen, only
for its Antiquity; for it is no very Elegant Building; yet it has this
Commendation, That it ſtands in the pureſt and moſt wholſome Air of the
whole City.</p>
               <p>There is another Mercat alſo wall'd in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of the
Goldſmiths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which has a <hi>Piazza</hi> ſupported by
Sixteen Pillars. In this are ſold all manner of Silks. And a little way off
from this, is the <hi>Bazar,</hi> where they ſell Slaves. So great are the
Gains of this Traffick, that thoſe who uſe it, pay to the <hi>Grand
Signior,</hi> by way of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> the Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sum of Sixteen
Thouſand <hi>Zequins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:102964:190"/>The Vintners, Victuallers, and Sutlers,
who ſell Wine to the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> and privately
to the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> pay Yearly Fifty Eight Thouſand, Seven
Hundred and Eighty Eight <hi>Zequins.</hi> The very Fiſher-men of
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> who live along the <hi>Strand,</hi> pay the Yearly
Sum of Twenty Nine Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Three Hundred Ninety Four <hi>Zequins.</hi> The
Corn-Market, where all Sorts of Grain, Pulſe, Meal and Flower are ſold,
pays Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Treaſury 14 Purſes of Money, each Purſe being worth
a Thouſand Six Hundred, Thirty and Three <hi>Zequins.</hi> The <hi>Egyptian
Merchants,</hi> who bring their Goods from <hi>Alcaire</hi> to ſell them at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> pay 24 Purſes. The Fraught of all Foreign Merchant
Ships, makes up 180 Purſes of Gold. I have mention'd the Value of each
Purſe before. The Great <hi>Shambles</hi> without the City, pays 32 Purſes.
There ſerve in this Place 200 Butchers; over whom there is a
<hi>Praefect</hi> or <hi>Maſter,</hi> without whoſe Conſent no Man can
kill any Beaſt, unleſs it be in the Caſe of <hi>Corban.</hi> Nay, ſo
great is the Authority of this <hi>Praefect,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi>
themſelves are forc'd to ask his Leave to kill their Beaſts after their
own-Faſhion. The Reaſon why the <hi>Shambles</hi> is without the City is
for <hi>Purity</hi>'s Sake, leſt the City be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with
<hi>Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is Impoſſible to caſt up the Prodigious
<hi>Revenue</hi> which ariſes to the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> from the Sale of
<hi>Hungarian</hi> Sheep and Oxen in the 10th. and 11th. <hi>Moons.</hi> But
thou <pb n="356" facs="tcp:102964:191"/>may'ſt comprehend that it is very Great, when
ſometimes in one Days time there are ſold 25000 Oxen, and 40000 Sheep.</p>
               <p>Neither is it more eaſie to reckon up his Incomes from the
Sale of Houſes, Skiffs, Galleys, Saicks, and bigger Veſſels. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it would be too tedious for one Letter. What ſhall I ſay of the
<hi>Tribute</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> pay,
amounting Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a Prodigious Sum of Money? Time, Paper, Ink, and Human
Patience it ſelf would fail, in rehearſing ſo many Particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
               <p>But thou may'ſt frame a Regular Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Immenſe
Riches which the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> is poſſeſs'd of; when thou
ſhalt know, that there is a <hi>Mint</hi> in the <hi>Imperial</hi> City where
Four Hundred Men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually labour in coining new Money, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a
<hi>Preſident</hi> or <hi>Overſeer</hi> who ſuperviſes the Work, who
muſt be a <hi>Graecian,</hi> by a ſpecial Privilege granted to that
<hi>Nation</hi> by our <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Emperors;</hi> becauſe the Mines of
Silver and Gold, are within the Limits of the <hi>Graecian Empire.</hi> So that
none but <hi>Greeks</hi> are admitted to aſſiſt at this curious
Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Preſident</hi> is oblig'd every <hi>New Moon</hi> to
ſend into the <hi>Serail</hi> Ten Thouſand <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi> of Gold, and
Twenty Thouſand in Silver. For ſuch is the Pleaſure of the <hi>Great
Sultan,</hi> that the <hi>Royal Palace</hi> ſhould always abound with fair
New Money.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:102964:191"/>Sage <hi>Muſu,</hi> aſſure thy
